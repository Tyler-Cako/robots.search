Computational neuroscientists typically face a difficult choice between symbolic model-driven approaches that are interpretable, but underperform at predicting animal behavior, versus data-driven approaches that train overparameterized models to make accurate behavioral predictions with often hard-to-interpret, blackbox models. In this work, we explore the use of an automated LLM-based program discovery tool (FunSearch, \cite{romeraparedes2024mathematical}) to discover novel symbolic programs that accurately describe animal behavior without sacrificing interpretability. We dub this CogFunSearch, and verify its efficacy on behavioral data from rodent reward-guided choice behaviors \cite{miller2021predictive}. We find that CogFunSearch is able to reliably discover programs that outperform the state-of-the-art cognitive model for predicting rat choices in a 2-armed drifting bandit task. This is the case both when CogFunSearch is used to improve on inputted programs, as well as when it is used to discover programs from scratch. Moreover, we find that CogFunSearch is sensitive to semantic information in the prompt: prompts that provide details of the dataset and suggest an RL modeling framework lead to quantitatively better programs than uninformative prompts. Both the classic models and the discovered programs are significantly outperformed by a simple, yet unconstrained, neural network, implying that there remains substantial room for improvement in the predictive performance of the discovered functions. Broadly, these results provide early insights into the use of LLM-based program discovery tools to find models of cognition.

We find that model performance tends to saturate at this scale on many common Western-centric classification and retrieval benchmarks, such as COCO Captions. Nevertheless, tasks of cultural diversity achieve more substantial gains from the 100-billion scale web data, thanks to its coverage of long-tail concepts. Furthermore, we analyze the model's multilinguality and show gains in low-resource languages as well. In addition, we observe that reducing the size of the pretraining dataset via quality filters like using CLIP, typically used to enhance performance, may inadvertently reduce the cultural diversity represented even in large-scale datasets. Our results highlight that while traditional benchmarks may not benefit significantly from scaling noisy, raw web data to 100 billion examples, this data scale is vital for building truly inclusive multimodal systems.

This may be mitigated by accounting for epistemic uncertainty, which is however challenging to estimate efficiently for large neural networks. To this extent we investigate the Delta Variance family, a family of algorithms for epistemic uncertainty quantification, that is computationally efficient and convenient to implement. It can be applied to neural networks and more general functions composed of neural networks. As an example we consider a weather simulator with a neural-network-based step function inside - here Delta Variances empirically obtain competitive results at the cost of a single gradient computation. The approach is convenient as it requires no changes to the neural network architecture or training procedure. We discuss multiple ways to derive Delta Variances theoretically noting that special cases recover popular techniques and present a unified perspective on multiple related methods. Finally we observe that this general perspective gives rise to a natural extension and empirically show its benefit.

In particular, program mutation can alter the test’s control and data flow inside the kernel by inserting new system calls, changing the values of call arguments, or performing other program mutations. However, due to the complexity of the kernel code and its user-space interface, finding the effective mutation that can lead to the desired outcome such as increasing the coverage and reaching a target code location is extremely difficult, even with the widespread use of manually-crafted heuristics. This work proposes Snowplow, a kernel fuzzer that uses a learned white-box test mutator to enhance test mutation. The core of Snowplow is an efficient machine learning model that can learn to predict promising mutations given the test program to mutate, its kernel code coverage, and the desired coverage. Snowplow is demonstrated on argument mutations of the kernel tests, and evaluated on recent Linux kernel releases. When fuzzing the kernels for 24 hours, Snowplow shows a significant speedup of discovering new coverage (4.8×∼5.2×) and achieves higher overall coverage (7.0%∼8.6%). In a 7-day fuzzing campaign, Snowplow discovers 86 previously-unknown crashes. Furthermore, the learned mutator is shown to accelerate directed kernel fuzzing by reaching 19 target code locations 8.5× faster and two additional locations that are missed by the state-of-the-art directed kernel fuzzer.

For this reason, self-supervised image-only pretraining is still the go-to method for many dense vision applications (e.g. depth estimation, semantic segmentation), despite the lack of explicit supervisory signals. In this paper, we close this gap between image-text and self-supervised learning, by proposing a novel general-purpose image-text model, which can be effectively used off the shelf for dense and global vision tasks. Our method, which we refer to as Text-Image Pretraining with Spatial awareness (TIPS), leverages two simple and effective insights. First, on textual supervision: we reveal that replacing noisy web image captions by synthetically generated textual descriptions boosts dense understanding performance significantly, due to a much richer signal for learning spatially aware representations. We propose an adapted training method that combines noisy and synthetic captions, resulting in improvements across both dense and global understanding tasks. Second, on the learning technique: we propose to combine contrastive image-text learning with self-supervised masked image modeling, to encourage spatial coherence, unlocking substantial enhancements for downstream applications. Building on these two ideas, we scale our model using the transformer architecture, trained on a curated set of public images. Our experiments are conducted on 8 tasks involving 16 datasets in total, demonstrating strong off-the-shelf performance on both dense and global understanding, for several image-only and image-text tasks.

Unlike the Boltzmann and Gibbs-Shannon entropies, it requires no prior commitment to macrovariables or probabilistic ensembles, rendering it applicable to settings arbitrarily far from equilibrium. For measure-preserving dynamical systems equipped with a Markovian coarse-graining, we prove a number of fluctuation inequalities. These include algorithmic versions of Jarzynski's equality, Landauer's principle, and the second law of thermodynamics. In general, the algorithmic entropy determines a system's actual capacity to do work from an individual state, whereas the Gibbs-Shannon entropy only gives the mean capacity to do work from a state ensemble that is known a priori.

A ""visual analogy"" is an abstract rule inferred from one image and applied to another. While benchmarks exist for testing visual reasoning in LMMs, they require advanced skills and omit basic visual analogies that even young children can make. Inspired by developmental psychology, we propose a new benchmark of 4,300 visual transformations of everyday objects to test LMMs on visual analogical reasoning and compare them to children (ages three to five) and to adults. We structure the evaluation into three stages: identifying what changed (e.g., color, number, etc.), how it changed (e.g., added one object), and applying the rule to new scenarios. Our findings show that while GPT-o1, GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MANTIS identify the ""what"" effectively, they struggle with quantifying the ""how"" and extrapolating this rule to new objects. In contrast, children and adults exhibit much stronger analogical reasoning at all three stages. Additionally, the strongest tested model, GPT-o1, performs better in tasks involving simple surface-level visual attributes like color and size, correlating with quicker human adult response times. Conversely, more complex tasks such as number, rotation, and reflection, which necessitate extensive cognitive processing and understanding of extrinsic spatial properties in the physical world, present more significant challenges. Altogether, these findings highlight the limitations of training models on data that primarily consists of 2D images and text.

However, both the LLM and the vision encoder come with their own set of biases, cue preferences, and shortcuts, which have been rigorously studied in uni-modal models. A timely question is how such (potentially misaligned) biases and cue preferences behave under multi-modal fusion in VLMs. As a first step towards a better understanding, we investigate a particularly well-studied vision-only bias - the texture vs. shape bias and the dominance of local over global information. As expected, we find that VLMs inherit this bias to some extent from their vision encoders. Surprisingly, the multi-modality alone proves to have important effects on the model behavior, i.e., the joint training and the language querying change the way visual cues are processed. While this direct impact of language-informed training on a model’s visual perception is intriguing, it raises further questions on our ability to actively steer a model’s output so that its prediction is based on particular visual cues of the user’s choice. Interestingly, VLMs have an inherent tendency to recognize objects based on shape information, which is different from what a plain vision encoder would do. Further active steering towards shape-based classifications through language prompts is however limited. In contrast, active VLM steering towards texture-based decisions through simple natural language prompts is often more successful.

However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks.

We anticipate that within our lifetimes it may become common practice for people to create a custom AI agent to interact with loved ones and/or the broader world after death; we call such embodiments generative ghosts since such agents will be capable of generating novel content rather than merely parroting content produced by their creator while living. In this position paper, we first discuss the design space of potential implementations of generative ghosts. We then discuss the practical and ethical implications of generative ghosts, including potential positive and negative impacts on individuals and society. Based on these considerations, we lay out a research agenda for the AI and HCI research communities to empower people to create and interact with AI afterlives in a safe and beneficial manner.

This paper investigates the synergy between these disciplines in two directions: AIT for Kernel Methods and Kernel Methods for AIT. In the former, we explore how AIT concepts inspire the design of kernels that integrate principles like relative Kolmogorov complexity and normalized compression distance (NCD). We also leverage the Loss Rank Principle (LoRP) to learn kernels in the context of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), extending the applicability of AIT-inspired techniques to flexible, nonparametric models. In the latter, we show how kernel methods can be used to approximate measures such as NCD and Algorithmic Mutual Information (AMI), providing new tools for compression-based analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) approximates AMI, offering a robust theoretical foundation for clustering and other dependence-measurement tasks.  Building on our previous work introducing Sparse Kernel Flows from an AIT perspective, we extend these ideas to unsupervised learning, enhancing the theoretical robustness and interpretability of ML algorithms. Our results demonstrate that kernel methods are not only versatile tools for ML but also crucial for bridging AIT and ML, enabling more principled approaches to unsupervised learning tasks. Keywords.

A user could describe a desired sensing task in natural language (e.g., ""alert if my toddler is getting into mischief""), with the MLLM analyzing the camera feed and responding within seconds. In a formative study, we found that users saw substantial value in defining their own sensors, yet struggled to articulate their unique personal requirements and debug the sensors through prompting alone. To address these challenges, we developed Gensors, a system that empowers users to define customized sensors supported by the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Gensors 1) assists users in eliciting requirements through both automatically-generated and manually created sensor criteria, 2) facilitates debugging by allowing users to isolate and test individual criteria in parallel, 3) suggests additional criteria based on user-provided images, and 4) proposes test cases to help users ""stress test"" sensors on potentially unforeseen scenarios. In a user study, participants reported significantly greater sense of control, understanding, and ease of communication when defining sensors using Gensors. Beyond addressing model limitations, Gensors supported users in debugging, eliciting requirements, and expressing unique personal requirements to the sensor through criteria-based reasoning; it also helped uncover users' ""blind spots"" by exposing overlooked criteria and revealing unanticipated failure modes. Finally, we discuss how unique characteristics of MLLMs--such as hallucinations and inconsistent responses--can impact the sensor-creation process. These findings contribute to the design of future intelligent sensing systems that are intuitive and customizable by everyday users.

In contrast to autoregressive (AR) tasks, such as language processing, our focus is on scenarios with multiple agents whose interactions are shaped by physical constraints and internal motivations. To this end, we propose Poly-Autoregressive (PAR) modeling, which forecasts an ego agent's future behavior by reasoning about the ego agent's state history and the past and current states of other interacting agents. At its core, PAR represents the behavior of all agents as a sequence of tokens, each representing an agent's state at a specific timestep. With minimal data pre-processing changes, we show that PAR can be applied to three different problems: human action forecasting in social situations, trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles, and object pose forecasting during hand-object interaction. Using a small proof-of-concept transformer backbone, PAR outperforms AR across these three scenarios.

We propose a training method which avoids agents learning undesired multi-step plans that receive high reward even if humans are not able to detect that the behaviour is undesired. The method, Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval (MONA), works by combining short-sighted optimization with far-sighted reward. We demonstrate that MONA can prevent multi-step reward hacking that ordinary RL causes, even without being able to detect the reward hacking and without any extra information that the ordinary RL does not get access to. We study MONA empirically in three settings which model different misalignment failure modes including 2-step environments with LLMs representing delegated oversight and encoded reasoning and longer-horizon gridworld environments representing sensor tampering.

Despite the promise, their performance on real-world applications that often involve combinations of tasks is still underexplored. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark, called CompWoB -- 50 new compositional web automation tasks reflecting more realistic assumptions. We show that while existing prompted LMAs (gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4) achieve 94.0% average success rate on base tasks, their performance degrades to 24.9% success rate on compositional tasks. On the other hand, transferred LMAs (finetuned only on base tasks) show less generalization gap, dropping from 85.4% to 54.8%. By balancing data distribution across tasks, we train a new model, HTML-T5++, that surpasses human-level performance (95.2%) on MiniWoB, and achieves the best zero-shot performance on CompWoB (61.5%). While these highlight the promise of small-scale finetuned and transferred models for task compositionality, their performance further degrades under different instruction compositions changing combinational order. In contrast to the recent remarkable success of LMA, our benchmark and detailed analysis emphasize the necessity of building LMAs that are robust and generalizable to task compositionality for real-world deployment.

Which one do researchers mean when they talk about ``planning as inference''? There is no consistency in the literature, different types are used, and their ability to do planning is further entangled with specific approximations or additional constraints. In this work we use the variational framework to show that all commonly used types of inference correspond to different weighings of the entropy terms in the variational problem, and that planning corresponds exactly to a different set of weights. This means that all the tricks of variational inference are readily applicable to planning. We develop an analogue of loopy belief propagation that allows us to perform approximate planning in factored-state Markov decisions processes without incurring intractability due to the exponentially large state space.  The variational perspective shows that the previous types of inference for planning are only adequate in environments with low stochasticity, and allows us to characterize each type by its own merits, disentangling the type of inference from the additional approximations that its practical use requires. We validate these results empirically on synthetic MDPs and tasks posed on the International Planning Competition.

Capitalizing on Gemini's inherent multilingual and code understanding capabilities, Gemini Embedding produces highly generalizable embeddings for text spanning numerous languages and textual modalities. The representations generated by Gemini Embedding can be precomputed and applied to a variety of downstream tasks including classification, similarity, clustering, ranking, and retrieval. Evaluated on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB), which includes over one hundred tasks across 250+ languages, Gemini Embedding substantially outperforms prior state-of-the-art models, demonstrating considerable improvements in embedding quality. Achieving state-of-the-art performance across MMTEB's multilingual, English, and code benchmarks, our unified model demonstrates strong capabilities across a broad selection of tasks and surpasses specialized domain-specific models.

Our goal will be to construct a coding distribution that is both universal and can be used as a control policy. Allowing for action generation needs careful treatment, as naive approaches which do not distinguish between actions and observations run into the self-delusion problem in universal settings. We showcase our perspective in the context of the challenging non-stationary stochastic bernoulli bandit problem. Our main contribution is an efficient and high performing algorithm for the non-stationary Stochastic bernoulli bandit problem that generalises the Partition Tree Weighting universal source coding technique for passive prediction to the control setting.

This work takes a step towards that goal and presents the first learned robot agent that reaches amateur human-level performance in competitive table tennis. Table tennis is a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. In this paper, we contribute (1) a hierarchical and modular policy architecture consisting of (i) low level controllers with their detailed skill descriptors which model the agent's capabilities and help to bridge the sim-to-real gap and (ii) a high level controller that chooses the low level skills, (2) techniques for enabling zero-shot sim-to-real including an iterative approach to defining the task distribution that is grounded in the real-world and defines an automatic curriculum, and (3) real time adaptation to unseen opponents. Policy performance was assessed through 29 robot vs. human matches of which the robot won 45% (13/29). All humans were unseen players and their skill level varied from beginner to tournament level. Whilst the robot lost all matches vs. the most advanced players it won 100% matches vs. beginners and 55% matches vs. intermediate players, demonstrating solidly amateur human-level performance.

We study this underspecification problem in the context of text-to-image generation, and propose a probabilistic framework that can be used to construct customized T2I agents, which have the capability of interacting with the user by expressing uncertainty about their intent, seeking clarification, and iteratively aligning with the desired image that the user would like to see. We present blue prints for agents constructed under this framework, showcasing the dynamic user interactions it enables and the explainability of its state of mind. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the interface of our agent compared with traditional dialogue systems through a series of user studies. Empirically, we propose an evaluation pipeline to verify the performance of our proposed agent and user satisfaction conducted with human study.

Collective deliberation can be slow, difficult to scale, and unequally attentive to different voices. In this study, we trained an artificial intelligence (AI) to mediate human deliberation. Using participants’ personal opinions and critiques, the AI mediator iteratively generates and refines statements that express common ground among the group on social or political issues. Participants (N = 5734) preferred AI-generated statements to those written by human mediators, rating them as more informative, clear, and unbiased. Discussants often updated their views after the deliberation, converging on a shared perspective. Text embeddings revealed that successful group statements incorporated dissenting voices while respecting the majority position. These findings were replicated in a virtual citizens’ assembly involving a demographically representative sample of the UK population.

These aspirations are both numerous and varied, motivated by issues that pertain to privacy, copyright, safety, and more. For example, unlearning is often invoked as a solution for removing the effects of targeted information from a generative-AI model’s parameters, e.g., a particular individual’s personal data or in-copyright expression of Spiderman that was included in the model’s training data. Unlearning is also proposed as a way to prevent a model from generating targeted types of information in its outputs, e.g., generations that closely resemble a particular individual’s data or reflect the concept of “Spiderman.” Both of these goals—the targeted removal of information from a model and the targeted suppression of information from a model’s outputs—present various technical and substantive challenges. We provide a framework for thinking rigorously about these challenges, which enables us to be clear about why unlearning is not a general-purpose solution for circumscribing generative-AI model behavior in service of broader positive impact. We aim for conceptual clarity and to encourage more thoughtful communication among machine learning (ML), law, and policy experts who seek to develop and apply technical methods for compliance with policy objectives.

Both fields generally use representations as a means to understand or improve a system's computations. In this work, however, we explore surprising dissociations between representation and computation that may pose challenges for such efforts. We create datasets in which we attempt to match the computational role that different features play, while manipulating other properties of the features or the data. We train various deep learning architectures to compute these multiple abstract features about their inputs. We find that their learned feature representations are systematically biased towards representing some features more strongly than others, depending upon extraneous properties such as feature complexity, the order in which features are learned, and the distribution of features over the inputs. For example, features that are simpler to compute or learned first tend to be represented more strongly and densely than features that are more complex or learned later, even if all features are learned equally well. We also explore how these biases are affected by architectures, optimizers, and training regimes (e.g., in transformers, features decoded earlier in the output sequence also tend to be represented more strongly). Our results help to characterize the inductive biases of gradient-based representation learning. We then illustrate the downstream effects of these biases on various commonly-used methods for analyzing or intervening on representations. These results highlight a key challenge for interpretability—or for comparing the representations of models and brains—disentangling extraneous biases from the computationally important aspects of a system's internal representations.

We introduce a toy model in which to investigate emergent time asymmetries: the causal multibaker maps. These are reversible discrete-time dynamical systems with configurable causal interactions. Imposing a suitable initial condition or “Past Hypothesis”, and then coarse-graining, yields a Pearlean locally causal structure. While it is more common to speculate that the other arrows of time arise from the thermodynamic arrow, our model instead takes the causal arrow as fundamental. From it, we obtain the thermodynamic and epistemic arrows of time. The epistemic arrow concerns records, which we define to be systems that encode the state of another system at another time, regardless of the latter system’s dynamics. Such records exist of the past, but not of the future. We close with informal discussions of the evolutionary and agential arrows of time, and their relevance to decision theory.

However, human preferences can vary across individuals, and therefore should be represented distributionally. In this work, we introduce the distributional soft preference labels and improve Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a weighted geometric average of the LLM output likelihood in the loss function. This approach adjusts the scale of learning loss based on the soft labels such that the loss would approach zero when the responses are closer to equally preferred. This simple modification can be easily applied to any DPO-based methods and mitigate over-optimization and objective mismatch, which prior works suffer from. Our experiments simulate the soft preference labels with AI feedback from LLMs and demonstrate that geometric averaging consistently improves performance on standard benchmarks for alignment research. In particular, we observe more preferable responses than binary labels and significant improvements where modestly-confident labels are in the majority.

However, they have limited usefulness for long form creative writing because they lack long-range semantic coherence. We address this limitation by applying language models hierarchically ,in a system we call Dramatron. By building structural context via prompt chaining, Dramatron can generate coherent scripts and screenplays complete with a title, characters, story beats, location descriptions, and dialogue. We illustrate Dramatron’s usefulness as an interactive co-creative system with a user-study of 15 theatre and film industry professionals, who co-wrote theatre scripts and screenplays with Dramatron and engaged in open-ended interviews. We report reflections from our interviewees, and from independent reviewers who watched recent stagings of these works, to illustrate how both Dramatron and hierarchical text generation are useful for human-machine co-creativity. Finally, we discuss the suitability of Dramatron for co-creativity, ethical considerations–including plagiarism and bias–and participation models for the design and deployment of such tools.

It comes with a formal guarantee on the number of search steps before finding a solution node, that depends on the quality of the policy. In this paper we consider augmenting the information available to the LTS algorithm with a rerooter, which imperfectly predicts at any given node $n$ whether to focus the search onto the descendants of $n$, which corresponds to rerooting the search at $n$. The rerooter thus implicitly decomposes the search space into subtasks, each subtask $i$ corresponding to finding a node $n^{i+1}$ when starting the search at the node $n^i$. The node $n^{i+1}$ can be seen as the goal of subtask $i$. This new algorithm, √LTS (pronounced root-LTS), is a simple best-first search with a special cost function that allows for √LTS rerooting to arise naturally from how the cost function prioritizes the nodes. We prove that the number of search steps that √LTS takes is competitive with the best decomposition into subtasks, at the price of a factor that relates to the uncertainty of the rerooter. The speed-up compared to LTS without a rerooter can be exponential, and even a single rerooting point can --- in the best case --- reduce the number of search steps to its square root. Like the policy, the rerooter can be learnt from data and we expect √LTS to be applicable to a wide range of domains. Authors Laurent Orseau, Levi H. S.

Contrary to a common expectation that BO is suited to optimizing black-box functions, it actually requires domain knowledge about those functions to deploy BO successfully. Such domain knowledge often manifests in Gaussian process (GP) priors that specify initial beliefs on functions. However, even with expert knowledge, it is non-trivial to quantitatively define a prior. This is especially true for hyperparameter tuning problems on complex machine learning models, where landscapes of tuning objectives are often difficult to comprehend. We seek an alternative practice for setting these functional priors. In particular, we consider the scenario where we have data from similar functions that allow us to pre-train a tighter distribution a priori. We detail what pre-training entails for GPs using a KL divergence based loss function, and propose a new pre-training based BO framework named HyperBO. Theoretically, we show bounded posterior predictions and near-zero regrets for HyperBO without assuming the ""ground truth"" GP prior is known. To verify our approach in realistic setups, we collect a large multi-task hyperparameter tuning dataset by training tens of thousands of configurations of near-state-of-the-art deep learning models on popular image and text datasets, as well as a protein sequence dataset. Our results show that on average, HyperBO is able to locate good hyperparameters at least 3 times more efficiently than the best competing methods on both our new tuning dataset and existing multi-task BO benchmarks.

On the popular D4RL benchmark, we show performance that is significantly better than existing model-based offline planning methods using MPC and competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods. We additionally illustrate D-MPC's ability to optimize novel reward functions at run time and adapt to novel dynamics, and highlight its advantages compared to existing diffusion-based planning baselines.

In this paper, we provide one of the first comprehensive investigations into embedding-based regression and demonstrate that LLM embeddings as features can be better for high-dimensional regression tasks than using traditional feature engineering. This regression performance can be explained in part due to LLM embeddings over numeric data inherently preserving Lipschitz continuity over the feature space. Furthermore, we quantify the contribution of different model effects, most notably model size and language understanding, which we find surprisingly do not always improve regression performance.

While Vision Transformer (ViT) based models scale effectively to large data regimes, they fail to capitalize on this inherent redundancy, leading to higher computational costs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) networks demonstrate scalability while maintaining same inference-time costs, but they come with a larger parameter footprint. We present Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE), which utilizes a nested structure for experts, wherein individual experts fall on an increasing compute-accuracy curve. Given a compute budget, MoNE learns to dynamically choose tokens in a priority order, and thus redundant tokens are processed through cheaper nested experts. Using this framework, we achieve equivalent performance as the baseline models, while reducing inference time compute by over two-fold. We validate our approach on standard image and video datasets - ImageNet-21K, Kinetics400, and Something-Something-v2. We further highlight MoNE’s adaptability by showcasing its ability to maintain strong performance across different inference-time compute budgets on videos, using only a single trained model.

Second, it was shown that the sink equilibria of a game adequately capture the limit behavior of natural game dynamics. These two results have created a need and opportunity to articulate a principled computational theory of the meaning of the game that is based on game dynamics. Given any game in normal form, and any prior distribution of play, we study the problem of computing the asymptotic behavior of a class of natural dynamics called the noisy replicator dynamics as a limit distribution over the sink equilibria of the game. When the prior distribution has pure strategy support, we prove this distribution can be computed efficiently, in near-linear time to the size of the best-response graph. When the distribution can be sampled --- for example, if it is the uniform distribution over all mixed strategy profiles --- we show through experiments that the limit distribution of reasonably large games can be estimated quite accurately through sampling and simulation.

Generative machine-learning (ML) models have emerged as a promising tool in this space, building on the success of this approach in applications such as image, text and audio generation. Often, however, generative tasks in scientific domains have unique structures and features — such as complex symmetries and the requirement of exactness guarantees — that present both challenges and opportunities for ML. This Perspective outlines the advances in ML-based sampling motivated by lattice quantum field theory, in particular for the theory of quantum chromodynamics. Enabling calculations of the structure and interactions of matter from our most fundamental understanding of particle physics, lattice quantum chromodynamics is one of the main consumers of open-science supercomputing worldwide. The design of ML algorithms for this application faces profound challenges, including the necessity of scaling custom ML architectures to the largest supercomputers, but also promises immense benefits, and is spurring a wave of development in ML-based sampling more broadly. In lattice field theory, if this approach can realize its early promise it will be a transformative step towards first-principles physics calculations in particle, nuclear and condensed matter physics that are intractable with traditional approaches.

While the most common private learning algorithm, DP-SGD, adds independent Gaussian noise in each iteration, recent work on matrix factorization mechanisms has shown empirically that introducing correlations in the noise can greatly improve their utility. We characterize the asymptotic learning utility for any choice of the correlation function, giving precise analytical bounds for linear regression and as the solution to a convex program for general convex functions. We show, using these bounds, how correlated noise provably improves upon vanilla DP-SGD as a function of problem parameters such as the effective dimension and condition number. Moreover, our analytical expression for the near-optimal correlation function circumvents the cubic complexity of the semi-definite program used to optimize the noise correlation matrix in previous work. We validate our theory with experiments on private deep learning. Our work matches or outperforms prior work while being efficient both in terms of compute and memory. Authors Christopher A.

This framework introduces levels of AGI performance, generality, and autonomy, providing a common language to compare models, assess risks, and measure progress along the path to AGI. To develop our framework, we analyze existing definitions of AGI, and distill six principles that a useful ontology for AGI should satisfy. With these principles in mind, we propose ""Levels of AGI"" based on depth (performance) and breadth (generality) of capabilities, and reflect on how current systems fit into this ontology. We discuss the challenging requirements for future benchmarks that quantify the behavior and capabilities of AGI models against these levels. Finally, we discuss how these levels of AGI interact with deployment considerations such as autonomy and risk, and emphasize the importance of carefully selecting Human-AI Interaction paradigms for responsible and safe deployment of highly capable AI systems.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) rise in popularity, it is necessary to assess their capability in this domain. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework, grounded in science communication principles, to analyze LLM responses on climate change topics. This framework emphasizes both the presentational and epistemological adequacy of answers, offering a fine-grained analysis of LLM response systems. Spanning 8 dimensions, our framework discerns up to 30 distinct issues in model outputs. The task is an excellent real-world example for a growing number of problems where LLM abilities can exceed those of humans. To address these challenges, we provide a practical protocol for scalable oversight using AI assistance, and rely on raters with relevant educational background. We evaluate several recent LLMs and conduct a thorough analysis of the results. Our comprehensive analysis sheds light on the potential and limitations of LLMs in the realm of climate communication.

In this work, we introduce a new prompting approach, analogical reasoning, designed to automatically guide the reasoning process of large language models. Drawing inspiration from how humans recall relevant past experiences when addressing new challenges, our approach makes language models self-generate relevant exemplars or lessons in the context, before proceeding to solve the given problem. This method presents several advantages: it obviates the need for manual annotation or external data retrieval, offering generality and convenience, while also tailoring generated exemplars to each unique problem, offering adaptability. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms 0-shot CoT and few-shot CoT in a variety of reasoning tasks, including math problem solving in GSM8K and MATH, code generation in Codeforces, and other reasoning tasks in BIG-Bench, with an average accuracy gain of +5%.

We also adapt the proofs to AlphaGo's MCTS and its descendants (e.g., AlphaZero, Leela Zero) to also show $\exp_2(\exp_2(D - O(\log D)))$ regret.

Our approach employs two stages: (1) a matching stage, which independently locates a suitable candidate point match for the query point on every other frame, and (2) a refinement stage, which updates both the trajectory and query features based on local correlations. The resulting model surpasses all baseline methods by a significant margin on the TAP-Vid benchmark, as demonstrated by an approximate 20% absolute average Jaccard (AJ) improvement on DAVIS. Our model facilitates fast inference on long and high-resolution video sequences. On a modern GPU, our implementation has the capacity to track points faster than real-time, and can be flexibly extended to higher-resolution videos. Given the high-quality trajectories extracted from a large dataset, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept diffusion model which generates trajectories from static images, enabling plausible animations.

This analysis is key to DP-SGD's success in machine learning, but, is not readily applicable to the newer state-of-the-art algorithms. This is because these algorithms, known as DP-FTRL, use the matrix mechanism to add correlated noise instead of independent noise as in DP-SGD. In this paper, we propose ""MMCC"", the first algorithm to analyze privacy amplification via sampling for any generic matrix mechanism. MMCC is nearly tight in that it approaches a lower bound as ϵ→0. To analyze correlated outputs in MMCC, we prove that they can be analyzed as if they were independent, by conditioning them on prior outputs. Our ""conditional composition theorem"" has broad utility: we use it to show that the noise added to binary-tree-DP-FTRL can asymptotically match the noise added to DP-SGD with amplification. Our amplification algorithm also has practical empirical utility: we show it leads to significant improvement in the privacy-utility trade-offs for DP-FTRL algorithms on standard benchmarks.

Even though every game has a Nash equilibrium, it is not known whether there are deterministic behaviors of the players who play a game repeatedly that are guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium of the game from all starting points. If one assumes that the players’ behavior is a discrete-time or continuous-time rule whereby the current mixed strategy profile is mapped to the next, this question becomes a problem in the theory of dynamical systems. We apply this theory, and in particular Conley index theory, to prove a general impossibility result: There exist games, for which all game dynamics fail to converge to Nash equilibria from all starting points. The games which help prove this impossibility result are degenerate, but we conjecture that the same result holds, under computational complexity assumptions, for nondegenerate games. We also prove a stronger impossibility result for the solution concept of approximate Nash equilibria: For a set of games of positive measure, no game dynamics can converge to the set of approximate Nash equilibria for a sufficiently small yet substantial approximation bound. Our results establish that, although the notions of Nash equilibrium and its computation-inspired approximations are universally applicable in all games, they are fundamentally incomplete as predictors of long-term player behavior.

For example, video and audio are obtained at much higher rates than text and are roughly aligned in time. They are not necessarily synchronized with text which is often present as a global context, e.g. a title or description. Furthermore, video and audio inputs are of much larger volumes, and can grow with the increase of the video lengths, which naturally requires more compute dedicated to these modalities and makes modeling of long-range dependencies harder. We here decouple the multimodal modeling, dividing it into separate, focused autoregressive models, processing the inputs according to the characteristics of the modalities and their sampling rates. More specifically, we propose a multimodal model, consisting of an autoregressive component for the time-synchronized modalities (audio and video), and an autoregressive component for modalities which are not necessarily aligned in time but are still sequential. To address the long-sequences of the video-audio inputs, we propose to further partition the video and audio sequences and autoregressively process their compact learned representations. To that end, we propose a Combiner mechanism, which models the audio-video information within a video snippet. The Combiner first learns to extract audio and visual features from raw spatio-temporal signals, and then learns to fuse these features producing compact but expressive representations per snippet, which are added to the subsequent autoregressive modeling in time. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art on well established multimodal benchmarks, outperforming much larger models. It effectively addresses the high computational demand of media inputs by both learning compact representations, controlling the sequence length of the audio-video feature representations, and producing powerful visual and audio representations which allow for long-term dependencies and modeling of long-form video or video/audio inputs in time.

Using the concepts and principles to guide the reasoning steps, LLMs significantly improve their abilities in following a correct reasoning path towards the solution. We conduct experiments of STEP-BACK PROMPTING with PaLM-2 models and observe substantial performance gains on a wide range of challenging reasoning-intensive tasks including STEM, Knowledge QA, and Multi-Hop Reasoning. For instance, STEP-BACK PROMPTING improves PaLM-2L performance on MMLU Physics and Chemistry by 7% and 11%, TimeQA by 34%, and MuSiQue by 7%.

Using the concepts and principles to guide the reasoning steps, LLMs significantly improve their abilities in following a correct reasoning path towards the solution. We conduct experiments of STEP-BACK PROMPTING with PaLM-2 models and observe substantial performance gains on a wide range of challenging reasoning-intensive tasks including STEM, Knowledge QA, and Multi-Hop Reasoning. For instance, STEP-BACK PROMPTING improves PaLM-2L performance on MMLU Physics and Chemistry by 7% and 11%, TimeQA by 34%, and MuSiQue by 7%.",9 October 2023,"Steven Zheng, Swaroop Mishra, Xinyun Chen, Heng-Tze Cheng, Ed Chi, Quoc Le, Denny Zhou","['ai', 'agi', 'levels', 'breakthroughs', 'systems']"

We argue that the predominant approach of fixing the hash function for the lifetime of the hash table is suboptimal and propose adapting it to the current set of keys. In the prevailing view, good hash functions spread the keys ``randomly'' and are fast to evaluate. General-purpose ones (e.g. Murmur) are designed to do both while remaining agnostic to the distribution of the keys, which limits their bucketing ability and wastes computation. When these shortcomings are recognised, the user of the hash table may specify a hash function more tailored to the expected key distribution, but doing so almost always introduces an unbounded risk in case their assumptions do not bear out in practice. At the other, fully key-aware end of the spectrum, Perfect Hashing algorithms can discover hash functions to bucket a given set of keys optimally, but they are costly to run and require the keys to be known and fixed ahead of time. Our main conceptual contribution is that adapting the hash table's hash function to the keys online is necessary for the best performance as adaptivity allows for better bucketing of keys and faster hash functions. We instantiate the idea of online adaptation with minimal overhead and no change to the hash table API. The experiments show that the adaptive approach marries the common-case performance of weak hash functions with the robustness of general-purpose ones.

Owing to the inherent multi-modal nature of many robotic tasks, combined with the recent successes in generative modeling, researchers have turned to state-of-the-art probabilistic models such as diffusion models for policy representation. In this work, we revisit the choice of energy-based models (EBM) as a policy class. We show that the prevailing folklore---that energy models in high dimensional continuous spaces are notoriously difficult to train and hence impractical---is false. We develop a practical training objective and algorithm for energy models which combines several key ingredients: (i) ranking noise contrastive estimation (R-NCE), (ii) learnable negative samplers, and (iii) non-adversarial joint training. We prove that our proposed objective function is asymptotically consistent and quantify its limiting variance. On the other hand, we show that the Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC) objective is actually biased even at the population level, providing a mathematical explanation for the poor performance of IBC trained energy policies in several independent follow-up works. We further extend our algorithm to learn a continuous stochastic process that bridges noise and data, modeling this process with a family of EBMs indexed by scale variable. In doing so, we demonstrate that the core idea behind recent progress in generative modeling is actually compatible with EBMs. Altogether, our proposed training algorithms enable us to train energy based models as policies which compete with---and even outperform---diffusion models and other state-of-the-art approaches in several challenging multi-modal benchmarks: obstacle avoidance path planning and contact-rich block pushing.

Our method combines the strengths of foundation models that serve as generic and powerful state representations and successor features that can model the future occurrence of the states for a policy. π2vec represents the behavior of policies by capturing the statistics of the features from a pretrained model with the help of successor feature framework. We focus on the offline setting where policies and their representations are trained on a fixed dataset of trajectories. Finally, we employ linear regression on π2vec vector representations to predict the performance of held out policies. The synergy of these techniques results in a method for efficient policy evaluation in resource constrained environments.

In this work, we propose a new practical data extraction attack that we call ``neural phishing''. This attack enables an adversary to target and extract sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII), e.g., credit card numbers, from a model trained on user data with upwards of 10% attack success rates, at times, as high as 50%. Our attack assumes only that an adversary can insert as few as 10s of benign-appearing sentences into the training dataset using only vague priors on the structure of the user data.

In this paper, we work towards capturing both the 3D structure as well as the dynamics of real-world scenes from monocular real-world videos. Our model, the Dynamic Scene Transformer (DyST), builds upon recent work in neural scene representation and learns a latent decomposition into scene content as well as per-view scene dynamics and camera pose. This separation is achieved through a special co-training scheme on monocular videos and our new synthetic dataset DySO. DyST learns tangible latent representations for dynamic scenes that enable view generation with separate control over the camera and the content of the scene.

An Evaluation of LLMs' Humour Alignment with Comedians  Published 5 June 2024    View publication      Download                   Share                                                  Copy link                   ×                          Abstract We interviewed professional comedians who perform live shows in front of audiences and who use artificial intelligence in their artistic process. To that end, we recruited ten participants at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2023 and ten more participants online for 3-hour workshops on ""AI x Comedy"", aiming to ensure linguistic, cultural, gender, sexual, national and racial diversity among participants. The workshop consisted of a comedy writing session with large language models (LLMs), a human-computer interaction questionnaire to assess the Creativity Support Index of the AI writing tool, and a focus group. Guided discussions in the focus group touched about the comedians' motivations and artistic processes, the biases and potentials of the LLM tools and their limitations as a Creativity Support Tool, as well as the comedians' ethical concerns about bias, censorship and copyright. Participants noted that the moderation strategies used during instruction-tuning of the LLMs reinforced hegemonic viewpoints by erasing minority groups, and qualified this as a form of censorship. At the same time, the LLMs did not succeed as a good creativity support tool, by producing stereotypical and biased comedy tropes, akin to ""cruise ship comedy material from the 1950ies, but a bit less racist"". Our work extends scholarship about the subtle difference between ""offensive"" language as a practice of resistance---and, equivalently, in comedy, of ""punching up"" and satire---and harmful speech. We also interrogate the global value alignment behind such language models and discuss community-based value alignment and data ownership to build AI tools that better suit the artists' needs.

Traditional analytic simulators sometimes struggle to capture sufficiently realistic simulation which can lead to problems including the well known ""sim-to-real"" gap. Learned simulators have emerged as an alternative for better capturing real-world physical dynamics, but require access to privileged ground truth physics information such as precise object geometry or particle tracks. Here we propose a method for learning simulators directly from observations.  Visual Particle Dynamics (VPD) jointly learns a latent particle-based representation of 3D scenes, a neural simulator of the dynamics of that representation, and a renderer that can produce images of the scene from arbitrary views. VPD learns end to end from posed videos and does not require access to privileged information. Unlike existing 2D video prediction models, we show that 3D inductive biases enable VPD to compositionally generalize and make long-term predictions. These results pave the way for downstream applications ranging from video editing to robotic planning.

We present AlphaMissense, an adaptation of AlphaFold fine-tuned on human and primate variant population frequency databases to predict missense variant pathogenicity. By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data. The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect. As a resource to the community, we provide a database of predictions for all possible human single amino acid substitutions and classify 89% of missense variants as either likely benign or likely pathogenic.

Building upon this premise, this paper critically examines the role and efficacy of self-correction within LLMs, shedding light on its true potential and limitations. Central to our investigation is the notion of intrinsic self-correction, whereby an LLM attempts to correct its initial responses based solely on its inherent capabilities, without any external feedback. Contrary to popular belief, our research indicates that LLMs might find this task challenging, especially in the context of reasoning, and at times, their performance might even degrade post self-correction. Given our findings, we encourage the community to approach this concept with both prudence and critical consideration.

Feature visualizations attempt to answer this important question by visualizing highly activating patterns through optimization. Today, visualization methods form the foundation of our knowledge about the internal workings of neural networks, as a type of mechanistic interpretability. Here we ask: How reliable are feature visualizations? We start our investigation by developing network circuits that trick feature visualizations into showing arbitrary patterns that are completely disconnected from normal network behavior on natural input. We then provide evidence for a similar phenomenon occurring in standard, unmanipulated networks: feature visualizations are processed very differently from standard input, casting doubt on their ability to “explain” how neural networks process natural images. We underpin this empirical finding by theory proving that the set of functions that can be reliably understood by feature visualization is extremely small and does not include black-box neural networks.

In our approach, we approximate the joint distribution of a fully-flexible triclinic simulation box and particle coordinates to achieve a desired internal pressure. This novel extension of flow-based sampling to the isobaric-isothermal ensemble yields direct estimates of Gibbs free energies. We test our NPT-flow on monatomic water in the cubic and hexagonal ice phases and find excellent agreement of Gibbs free energies and other observables compared with established baselines.

While there has been much work on applying these representations to various types of signals, the portfolio of signal processing tools that has been built up around discrete signal representations has seen only limited application to the world of neural fields. In this paper, we address this problem by showing how a probabilistic re-interpretation of neural fields can enable their training and inference processes to become filter aware. The formulation we propose not only merges training and filtering in an efficient way, but also generalizes beyond the familiar Euclidean coordinate spaces to the more general set of smooth manifolds and convolutions induced by the actions of Lie groups. We demonstrate how this framework can enable novel filtering applications for neural fields on both Euclidean domains, such as images and audio, as well as non-Euclidean domains, such as rotations and rays. This is achieved with minimal modification to network architecture and training pipelines, and without an increase in computational complexity.

Perhaps the next milestone for generative models is to simulate the real world in response to actions carried out by humans, robots, and other types of interactive agents. Applications of a real-world simulator range from controllable content creation in games and movies to training embodied agents purely in simulation that can be directly deployed in the real world. In this paper, we explore these possibilities around learning a universal simulator (UniSim) of real-world interactions through generative modeling. We first make the important observation that natural datasets available for learning a real-world simulator are often rich in different axes (e.g., rich labeled objects in image data, rich actions in robotics data, and rich movements in navigation data). With careful orchestration of diverse datasets each serving a different piece of the puzzle, UniSim can emulate how humans and agents interact with the world by simulating the visual outcome of both high-level instructions such as “open the drawer” and low-level controls such as “move to x, y location” from otherwise static scenes and objects. The usage of a real-world simulator is vast. As an example, we use UniSim to simulate interactive experiences to train high-level vision-language planners and low-level reinforcement learning policies, both of which exhibit significant real-world transfer from purely training in a real-world like simulator. Lastly, we show that other types of intelligence such as video captioning and detection models can also benefit from simulated experiences of UniSim, opening up even wider applications of a real-world simulator.

Their utility is assumed to be in identifying training examples ""responsible"" for a prediction so that, for example, correcting a prediction is possible by intervening on those examples (removing or editing them) and retraining the model. However, recent empirical studies have shown that the existing methods of estimating IF predict the leave-one-out-and-retrain effect poorly. In order to understand the mismatch between the theoretical promise and the practical results, we analyse five assumptions made by IF methods which are problematic for modern-scale deep neural networks and which concern convexity, numeric stability, training trajectory and parameter divergence. This allows us to clarify what can be expected theoretically from IF. We show that while most assumptions can be addressed successfully, the parameter divergence poses a clear limitation on the predictive power of IF: influence fades over training time even with deterministic training. We illustrate this theoretical result with BERT and ResNet models. Another conclusion from the theoretical analysis is that IF are still useful for model debugging and correcting even though some of the assumptions made in prior work do not hold: using natural language processing and computer vision tasks, we verify that mis-predictions can be successfully corrected by taking only a few fine-tuning steps on influential examples.

First presented in Universal Algorithmic Intelligence (Hutter, 2000), UAI offers a framework in which virtually all AI problems can be formulated, and a theory of how to solve them. UAI unifies ideas from sequential decision theory, Bayesian inference, and algorithmic information theory to construct AIXI, an optimal reinforcement learning agent that learns to act optimally in unknown environments. AIXI is the theoretical gold standard for intelligent behavior. The book covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of UAI. Bayesian updating can be done efficiently with context tree weighting, and planning can be approximated by sampling with Monte Carlo tree search. It provides algorithms for the reader to implement, and experimental results to compare against. These algorithms are used to approximate AIXI. The book ends with a philosophical discussion of Artificial General Intelligence: Can super-intelligent agents even be constructed? Is it inevitable that they will be constructed, and what are the potential consequences? This text is suitable for late undergraduate students. It provides an extensive chapter to fill in the required mathematics, probability, information, and computability theory background.

Current methods to quantify them are either heuristic or computationally demanding. We introduce BayesRays, a post-hoc framework to evaluate uncertainty in any pre-trained NeRF without modifying the training process. Our method establishes a volumetric uncertainty field using spatial perturbations and a Bayesian Laplace approximation. We derive our algorithm statistically and show its superior performance in key metrics and applications.

Our compiler, Tracr, generates models with known structure. This structure can be used to design experiments. For example, we use it to study ""superposition"" in transformers that execute multi-step algorithms. Additionally, the known structure of Tracr-compiled models can serve as ground-truth for evaluating interpretability methods. Commonly, because the ""programs"" learned by transformers are unknown it is unclear whether an interpretation succeeded. We demonstrate our approach by implementing and examining programs including computing token frequencies, sorting, and parenthesis checking. We provide an open-source implementation of Tracr at https://github.com/google-deepmind/tracr.

Many stakeholders -- such as researchers, policy makers, and insurers -- use this data to better understand the earth system and guide policy decisions. Atmospheric states have also received increased interest as machine learning approaches to weather prediction have shown promising results. A key issue for all audiences is that dense time series of these high-dimensional states comprise an enormous amount of data, precluding all but the most well resourced groups from accessing and using historical data and future projections. To address this problem, we propose a method for compressing atmospheric states using methods from the neural network literature, adapting spherical data to processing by conventional neural architectures through the use of the area-preserving HEALPix projection. We investigate two model classes for building neural compressors: the hyperprior model from the neural image compression literature and recent vector-quantised models. We show that both families of models satisfy the desiderata of small average error, a small number of high-error reconstructed pixels, faithful reproduction of extreme events such as hurricanes and heatwaves, preservation of the spectral power distribution across spatial scales. We demonstrate compression ratios in excess of 1000x, with compression and decompression at a rate of approximately one second per global atmospheric state.

Current approaches lack either the generality to onboard new tasks without task-specific engineering, or else lack the data-efficiency to do so in an amount of time that enables practical use. In this work we explore dense tracking as a representational bottleneck to allow fast and general-purpose learning from demonstration. Our approach utilizes Track-Any-Point (TAP) models to isolate the relevant motion in a demonstration, and parameterize a low-level controller to reproduce this motion across changes in the scene. We show that this results in robust robot policies that can solve complex object-arrangement tasks such as kitting, stacking up to four objects, and even full path-following tasks such as applying glue and sticking objects together, all from demonstrations that can be collected in minutes.

By inducing correlations between the trajectories of an interacting ensemble such that their marginal transition probabilities are unmodified, we are able to explore the graph more efficiently, improving the concentration of statistical estimators whilst leaving them unbiased. The mechanism has a trivial drop-in implementation. We showcase the effectiveness of repelling random walks in a range of settings including estimation of graph kernels, the PageRank vector and graphlet concentrations. We provide detailed experimental evaluation and robust theoretical guarantees. To our knowledge, repelling random walks constitute the first rigorously studied quasi-Monte Carlo scheme correlating the directions of walkers on a graph, inviting new research in this exciting nascent domain.

This includes many of the most popular examples of kernels defined on the nodes of a graph. Our algorithm enjoys subquadratic time complexity with respect to the number of nodes, overcoming the notoriously prohibitive cubic scaling of exact graph kernel evaluation. It can also be trivially distributed across machines, permitting learning on much larger networks. At the heart of the algorithm is a modulation function which upweights or downweights the contribution from different random walks depending on their lengths. We show that by parameterising it with a neural network we can obtain u-GRFs that give higher-quality kernel estimates or perform efficient, scalable kernel learning. We provide robust theoretical analysis and support our findings with experiments including pointwise estimation of fixed graph kernels, solving non-homogeneous graph ordinary differential equations, node clustering and kernel regression on triangular meshes.

Key challenges in OCL include automatic adaptation to the specific non-stationary structure of the data and maintaining appropriate predictive uncertainty. To address these challenges we introduce a probabilistic Bayesian online learning approach that utilizes a (possibly pretrained) neural representation and a state space model over the linear predictor weights. Non-stationarity in the linear predictor weights is modelled using a “parameter drift” transition density, parametrized by a coefficient that quantifies forgetting. Inference in the model is implemented with efficient Kalman filter recursions which track the posterior distribution over the linear weights, while online SGD updates over the transition dynamics coefficient allow for adaptation to the non-stationarity observed in the data. While the framework is developed assuming a linear Gaussian model, we extend it to deal with classification problems and for fine-tuning the deep learning representation. In a set of experiments in multi-class classification using data sets such as CIFAR-100 and CLOC we demonstrate the model’s predictive ability and its flexibility in capturing non-stationarity.

The integration of both approaches has proven to be highly successful in addressing complex sequential decision-making challenges, as evidenced by algorithms such as AlphaZero and MuZero, which consolidate the planning process into a parametric search-policy. AIXI, the most potent theoretical universal agent, leverages planning through comprehensive search as its primary means to find an optimal policy. Here we define an alternative universal agent, which we call Self-AIXI, that on the contrary to AIXI, maximally exploits learning to obtain good policies. It does so by self-predicting its own stream of action data, which is generated, similarly to other TD(0) agents, by taking an action maximization step over the current on-policy (universal mixture-policy) Q-value estimates. We prove that Self-AIXI converges to AIXI, and inherits a series of properties like maximal Legg-Hutter intelligence and the self-optimizing property.

Inverse graphics is an appealing approach to 3D scene understanding that aims to infer the 3D scene structure from 2D images. In this paper, we introduce probabilistic modeling to the inverse graphics framework to quantify uncertainty and achieve robustness in 6D pose estimation tasks. Specifically, we propose 3D Neural Embedding Likelihood (3DNEL) as a unified probabilistic model over RGB-D images, and develop efficient inference procedures on 3D scene descriptions. 3DNEL effectively combines learned neural embeddings from RGB with depth information to improve robustness in sim-to-real 6D object pose estimation from RGB-D images. Performance on the YCB-Video dataset is on par with state-of-the-art yet is much more robust in challenging regimes. In contrast to discriminative approaches, 3DNEL's probabilistic generative formulation jointly models multiple objects in a scene, quantifies uncertainty in a principled way, and handles object pose tracking under heavy occlusion. Finally, 3DNEL provides a principled framework for incorporating prior knowledge about the scene and objects, which allows natural extension to additional tasks like camera pose tracking from video.

Large language models (LMs) achieve above-chance performance on abstract reasoning tasks but exhibit many imperfections. However, human abstract reasoning is also imperfect. Human reasoning is affected by our real-world knowledge and beliefs, and shows notable “content effects”; humans reason more reliably when the semantic content of a problem supports the correct logical inferences. These content-entangled reasoning patterns are central to debates about the fundamental nature of human intelligence. Here, we investigate whether language models—whose prior expectations capture some aspects of human knowledge—similarly mix content into their answers to logic problems. We explored this question across three logical reasoning tasks: natural language inference, judging the logical validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. We evaluate state of the art LMs, as well as humans, and find that the LMs reflect many of the same qualitative human patterns on these tasks—like humans, models answer more accurately when the semantic content of a task supports the logical inferences. These parallels are reflected in accuracy patterns, and in some lower-level features like the relationship between LM confidence over possible answers and human response times. However, in some cases the humans and models behave differently—particularly on the Wason task, where humans perform much worse than large models, and exhibit a distinct error pattern. Our findings have implications for understanding possible contributors to these human cognitive effects, as well as the factors that influence language model performance.

Although past work created increasingly general solutions for the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) formulation, these have not been successfully scaled to world-sized MDPs (200M states), large datasets (110M samples), and nearly foundation-sized models (360M parameters). In this work, we surpass this scale through a series of advancements focused on graph compression, parallelization, and problem initialization based on dominant eigenvectors. We introduce Receding Horizon Inverse Planning (RHIP), an approximated IRL algorithm which generalizes existing work and enables control of key performance trade-offs via a planning horizon parameter. Our policy achieves an 18% improvement in global route quality, and, to our knowledge, is the largest instance of IRL in a real-world setting to date. We include insightful negative results on state-of-the-art eigenvalue solvers, and identify future opportunities to further improve performance via IRL-specific batching strategies. Our results show critical benefits to more sustainable modes of transportation (e.g. two-wheelers), where factors beyond journey time (e.g. route safety) play an outsized role.

The method requires no explicit orthogonalization of the different states, instead transforming the problem of finding excited states of a given system into that of finding the ground state of an expanded system. Expected values of arbitrary observables can be calculated, including mixed expectations between different states such as the transition dipole moment. Although the method is entirely general, it works particularly well in conjunction with recent work on using neural networks as variational Ansätze for many-electron systems, and we show that by combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer Ansätze we can accurately recover vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths on molecules as large as benzene. Beyond the examples on molecules presented here, we expect this technique will be of great interest for applications of variational quantum Monte Carlo to atomic, nuclear and condensed matter physics.

Often, task success is defined based on the relationship between two objects - for instance, hanging a mug on a rack.  In such cases, the solution should be equivariant to the initial position of the objects as well as the agent, and invariant to the pose of the camera. This poses a challenge for learning systems which attempt to solve this task by learning directly from high-dimensional demonstrations: the agent must learn to be both equivariant as well as precise, which can be challenging without any inductive biases about the problem. In this work, we propose a method for precise relative pose prediction which is provably SE(3)-equivariant, can be learned from only a few demonstrations, and can generalize across variations in a class of objects. We accomplish this by factoring the problem into learning an SE(3) invariant task-specific representation of the scene and then interpreting this representation with novel geometric reasoning layers which are provably SE(3) equivariant. We demonstrate that our method can yield substantially more precise predictions in simulated placement tasks than previous methods trained with the same amount of data, and can accurately represent relative placement relationships data collected from real-world demonstrations.

Despite their success, MoEs suffer from a number of issues: training instability, token dropping, inability to scale the number of experts, or ineffective finetuning. In this work, we propose Soft MoE, a fully-differentiable sparse Transformer that addresses these challenges, while maintaining the benefits of MoEs. Soft MoE performs an implicit soft assignment by passing different weighted combinations of all input tokens to each expert. As in other MoEs, experts in Soft MoE only process a subset of the (combined) tokens, enabling larger model capacity (and performance) at lower inference cost. In the context of visual recognition, Soft MoE greatly outperforms dense Transformers (ViTs) and popular MoEs (Tokens Choice and Experts Choice). Furthermore, Soft MoE scales well: Soft MoE Huge/14 with 128 experts in 16 MoE layers has over $40\times$ more parameters than ViT Huge/14, with only 2% increased inference time, and substantially better quality.

We formulate this problem as a sequential decision-making problem and compare AlphaZero, a neural network-guided tree search, with tabu search, a heuristic local search method. Using either method, by introducing a curriculum—jump-starting the search for larger graphs using good graphs found at smaller sizes—we improve the state-of-the-art lower bounds for several sizes. We also propose a flexible graph-generation environment and a permutation-invariant network architecture for learning to search in the space of graphs.

SNNKs effectively disentangle the inputs from the parameters of the neural network in the FFL, only to connect them in the final computation via the dot-product kernel. They are also strictly more expressive, as allowing to model complicated relationships beyond the functions of the dot-products of parameter-input vectors. We also introduce the neural network bundling process that applies SNNKs to compactify deep neural network architectures, resulting in additional compression gains. In its extreme version, it leads to the fully bundled network whose optimal parameters can be expressed via explicit formulae for several loss functions (e.g. mean squared error), opening a possibility to bypass backpropagation. As a by-product of our analysis, we introduce the mechanism of the universal random features (or URFs), applied to instantiate several SNNK variants, and interesting on its own in the context of scalable kernel methods. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis of all these concepts as well as an extensive empirical evaluation, ranging from point-wise kernel estimation to Transformers' fine-tuning with novel adapter layers inspired by SNNKs. Our mechanism provides up to 5x reduction in the number of trainable parameters, while maintaining competitive accuracy.

In this paper, we foreground the concept of role-play. Casting dialogue agent behaviour in terms of role-play allows us to draw on familiar folk psychological terms, without ascribing human characteristics to language models they in fact lack. Two important cases of dialogue agent behaviour are addressed this way, namely (apparent) deception and (apparent) self-awareness.

GraphCast operates on a0.25°latitude-longitude grid, and uses graph neural networks and a novel high-resolution multi-scale mesh representation, to autoregressively predict the 10-day temporal trajectories of 227 key dynamic variables that represent the state of the atmosphere, at 6-hour time intervals. Our results show GraphCast is significantly more accurate than the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)’s deterministic forecasting system, “HRES”, on89.3%of the 2760 target variables and lead times we evaluated. It also outperforms the most accurate previous machine learning weather forecasting model on98.8%of the 252 targets it reported. GraphCast is orders of magnitude faster than ECMWF’s operational systems, and can generate a 10-day forecast (35 gigabytes on disk) in under 60 seconds on Cloud TPU hardware. Together these results represent a key step forward in improving weather modeling with machine learning, open new opportunities for fast, accurate forecasting, and help realize the promise of machine-learning based simulation in the physical sciences.

While Neural Fields have recently become popular, it is often trained by uniformly randomly sampling the training domain, or through handcrafted heuristics. In this work, we show that improved convergence and final training quality can be achieved by smarter sampling. Specifically, we propose a sampling scheme based on Langevin Monte-Carlo sampling that focuses our training samples in the domain where it actually matters.

We observe that gradient descent with momentum is a special case of meta-gradients, and building on recent results in optimisation, we prove convergence rates for meta learning in the single task setting. While a meta-learned update rule can yield faster convergence up to constant factor, it is not sufficient for acceleration. Instead, some form of optimism is required. We show that optimism in meta-learning can be captured through the recently proposed Bootstrapped Meta-Gradient (Flennerhag et. al., 2022) method, providing deeper insight into its underlying mechanics.

Whilst a frontal- hippocampal circuit is known to be essential for this task, little is known about the associated neuronal computations. Although visual understanding appears superficially distinct from other known functions of this circuit, such as spatial reasoning, compositional inference, and model-based planning, recent models suggest deeper computational similarities. Here, using fMRI, we show that representations of visual objects in these brain regions are relational and compositional – key computational properties theorised to support rapid construction of hippocampal maps. Using MEG, we show that rapid sequences of representations, akin to replay in spatial navigation and planning problems, are also engaged in visual understanding. Whilst these sequences have previously been proposed as mechanisms to plan possible futures or learn from the past, here they are used to understand the present. Replay sequences change content over timescales of understanding and form constructive hypotheses about possible object configurations. These hypotheses play out in an order that supports relational inference, progressing from predictable to uncertain scene elements, gradually constraining possible configurations, and converging on the correct configuration. Together, these results suggest a computational bridge between apparently distinct functions of hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry, and a role for generative replay in compositional inference and hypothesis testing.

We used deep RL to train a humanoid robot to play a simplified one-versus-one soccer game. The resulting agent exhibits robust and dynamic movement skills, such as rapid fall recovery, walking, turning, and kicking, and it transitions between them in a smooth and efficient manner. It also learned to anticipate ball movements and block opponent shots. The agent’s tactical behavior adapts to specific game contexts in a way that would be impractical to manually design. Our agent was trained in simulation and transferred to real robots zero-shot. A combination of sufficiently high-frequency control, targeted dynamics randomization, and perturbations during training enabled good-quality transfer. In experiments, the agent walked 181% faster, turned 302% faster, took 63% less time to get up, and kicked a ball 34% faster than a scripted baseline.

While it is difficult to measure whether neural program synthesis methods have similar capabilities, we can measure whether they compositionally generalize, that is, whether a model that has been trained on the simpler subtasks is subsequently able to solve more complex tasks. In this paper, we characterize several different forms of compositional generalization that are desirable in program synthesis, forming a meta-benchmark which we use to create generalization tasks for two popular datasets, RobustFill and DeepCoder. We then propose ExeDec, a novel decomposition-based synthesis strategy that predicts execution subgoals to solve problems step-by-step informed by program execution at each step. When used with Transformer models trained from scratch, ExeDec has better synthesis performance and greatly improved compositional generalization ability compared to baselines. Finally, we use our benchmarks to demonstrate that LLMs struggle to compositionally generalize when asked to do programming-by-example in a few-shot setting, but an ExeDec-style prompting approach can improve the generalization ability and overall performance.

We collect realistic data by performing any user requests within the entirety of 3 office buildings and using multiple robot and human embodiments. With this data, we show that models trained on all embodiments perform better than ones trained on the robot data only, even when evaluated solely on robot episodes. We find that for a fixed collection budget it is beneficial to take advantage of cheaper human collection along with robot collection. We release a large and highly diverse (29,520 unique instructions) dataset dubbed RoboVQA containing 829,502 (video, text) pairs for robotics-focused visual question answering. We also demonstrate how evaluating real robot experiments with an intervention mechanism enables performing tasks to completion, making it deployable with human oversight even if imperfect while also providing a single performance metric. We demonstrate a single video-conditioned model named RoboVQA-VideoCoCa trained on our dataset that is capable of performing a variety of grounded high-level reasoning tasks in broad realistic settings with a cognitive intervention rate 46% lower than the zero-shot state of the art visual language model (VLM) baseline and is able to guide real robots through long-horizon tasks. The performance gap with zero-shot state-of-the-art models indicates that a lot of grounded data remains to be collected for real-world deployment, emphasizing the critical need for scalable data collection approaches. Finally, we show that video VLMs significantly outperform single-image VLMs with an average error rate reduction of 19% across all VQA tasks.

In sequential decision-making,  agent eval-uation  has  largely  been  restricted  to  very  few  interactions  against  experts,  declaring  victory  upon reaching  some  desired  level  of  performance  (e.g.human  professional).    In  this  paper,  we  propose a benchmark for multiagent learning based on repeated play of the simple game Rock, Paper, Scissors along with a population of forty-three  tournament entries,  some of which are (intentionally)sub-optimal.   We describe metrics to measure the quality of  agents  based  both  on  average  returns and exploitability.   We then show that several re-cent RL and online learning approaches can learng ood counter-strategies and generalize well, but ultimately lose to the top-performing bots,  creating an opportunity for research in multiagent learning.

A natural next question is whether these models can advance science through means such as generating novel stable materials. Traditionally, models with explicit structures (e.g., graphs) have been used in modeling structural relationships in scientific data (e.g., atoms and bonds in crystals), but generating structures explicitly might be difficult to scale to large and complex systems. Another challenge to generative models of materials lies in the mismatch between generative modeling metrics and the downstream applications. For instance, common metrics such as the reconstruction error do not correlate well with the downstream goal of discovering novel stable materials. In this work, we tackle the scalability challenge by first developing a unified crystal representation that can effectively represent any crystal structures (UniMat), followed by training a diffusion probabilistic model on the UniMat representations. Our empirical results suggest that despite the lack of explicit structure modeling, UniMat can generate high fidelity crystal structures from larger and more complex chemical systems, outperforming previous graph-based approaches under various generative modeling metrics. To better connect the generation quality of materials to downstream applications such as discovering novel stable materials, we propose to use decomposition energy from Density Function Theory (DFT) calculations and the resulting stability with respect to convex hulls as additional evaluation metrics for generative models of materials. Lastly, we show that conditional generation with UniMat can scale to previously established crystal datasets with up to millions of crystals structures, and outperform random structure search (the current leading method for structure discovery) in discovering new stable materials.

This paper proposes a simple efficient policy optimization framework---Optimistic NPG for online RL. Optimistic NPG can be viewed as simply combining of the classic natural policy gradient (NPG) algorithm [Kakade, 2001] with optimistic policy evaluation subroutines to encourage exploration. For $d$-dimensional linear MDPs, Optimistic NPG is computationally efficient, and learns an $\epsilon$-optimal policy within $\tilde{O}(d^2/\epsilon^3)$ samples, which is the first computationally efficient algorithm whose sample complexity has the optimal dimension dependence $\tilde{\Theta}(d^2)$. It also improves over state-of-the-art results of policy optimization algorithms [Zanette et al., 2021] by a factor of $d$. For general function approximation that subsumes linear MDPs, Optimistic NPG, to our best knowledge, is also the first policy optimization algorithm that achieves the polynomial sample complexity for learning near-optimal policies.

However, while LMs may appear well-calibrated over broad distributions, this often hides significant miscalibration within narrower slices (e.g., systemic over-confidence in math can balance out systemic under-confidence in history, yielding perfect calibration in aggregate). To attain well-calibrated confidence estimates for any slice of a distribution, we propose a new framework for few-shot slice-specific recalibration. Specifically, we train a recalibration model that takes in a few unlabeled examples from any given slice and predicts a curve that remaps confidence scores to be more accurate for that slice. Our trained model can recalibrate for arbitrary new slices, without using any labeled data from that slice. This enables us to identify domain-specific confidence thresholds above which the LM's predictions can be trusted, and below which it should abstain. Experiments show that our few-shot recalibrator consistently outperforms existing calibration methods, for instance improving calibration error for PaLM2-Large on MMLU by 16%, as compared to temperature scaling.

Gecko achieves strong retrieval performance by leveraging a key idea: distilling knowledge from large language models (LLMs) into a retriever. Our two-step distillation process begins with generating diverse, synthetic paired data using an LLM. Next, we further refine the data quality by retrieving a set of candidate passages for each query, and relabeling the positive and hard negative passages using the same LLM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by the compactness of the Gecko. On the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), Gecko with 256 embedding dimensions outperforms all existing entries with 768 embedding size. Gecko with 768 embedding dimensions achieves an average score of 66.31, competing with 7x larger models and 5x higher dimensional embeddings.

As far as we know, RandQL is the first feasible algorithm based on posterior sampling without needing a model. We evaluate RandQL's performance in both tabular and non-tabular settings. In tabular MDPs, RandQL achieves a regret bound of approximately O(sqrt(H^5 * S * A * T)), where H is the planning horizon, S is the number of states, A is the number of actions, and T is the number of episodes. For a metric state-action space, RandQL's regret bound is approximately O(H^(5/2) * T * (dz+1)/(dz+2)), where dz represents the zooming dimension. Importantly, RandQL achieves optimistic exploration without using bonuses; instead, it relies on a novel concept of randomizing the learning rate. Our experimental results demonstrate that RandQL surpasses existing methods in standard exploration environments.

Recent works have studied generalization in such settings, by leveraging policy conditioning with modalities such as natural language or object-centric visual representations. While these methods have shown promise in high-level generalization to semantics, objects, or visual distribution shifts, there remain significant open challenges in novel low-level motion generalization. This challenge is both a theoretical and practical barrier in scaling robot learning methods, as real-world robot situations may demand significantly more low-level motion capabilities than contained in common large-scale tabletop pick and place datasets. Towards tackling this, we propose policy conditioning with rough trajectory sketches, which strike a balance between being detailed enough to express low-level motion-centric guidance while being coarse enough to require learning-based policies to interpret the trajectory sketch in the context of situational visual observations. The trajectory sketch is also a scalable and flexible representation: during training it can be generated in hindsight from proprioception sensors and during inference time it can be specified through simple human inputs like drawing or videos, or through automated methods such as modern image-generating or waypoint-generating methods. We present trajectory-conditioned policies within a holistic framework, which we demonstrate at scale on a variety of real world robotic tasks which require diverse motions that go beyond tabletop pick and place tasks that our method was trained on.

The field of safety evaluations however remains nascent. In the development of Google DeepMind’s Gemini models, we innovated on and applied a diverse set of approaches to safety evaluation. To contribute to the maturation of the field, we share here some aspects of our evolving approach and lessons learned. First, theoretical frameworks are invaluable to organize the breadth of risk domains, modalities, forms, metrics, and goals. Second, theory and practice each benefit from collaboration: clarifying goals, methods, and challenges, and facilitating the transfer of insights and work across the evaluation development pipeline. Third, methods, lessons, and institutions transfer across the range of concerns in responsibility and safety, including present harms and dangerous capabilities. Safety evaluations are a public good, and as such we need to rapidly advance the science of evals, the thickness of scientifically-grounded norms and standards, the innovativeness of the ecosystem, and the integration of these measures into company policy and public policy.

For larger systems, efficient but less reliable empirical force fields are used. Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) offer similar accuracy as ab initio methods at orders-of-magnitude speedup, but struggle to model long-range interactions in large molecules. This work proposes a general approach to constructing accurate MLFFs for large-scale molecular simulations (GEMS) by training on “bottom-up” and “top-down” molecular fragments, from which the relevant interactions can be learned. GEMS allows nanosecond-scale MD simulations of >25,000 atoms at essentially ab initio quality, correctly predicts dynamical oscillations between different helical motifs in polyalanine, and yields good agreement with terahertz vibrational spectroscopy for large-scale protein-water fluctuations in solvated crambin. Our analyses indicate that simulations at ab initio accuracy might be necessary to understand dynamic biomolecular processes.

Their incorporation has been rapid and transformative, marking a significant paradigm shift in the field of machine learning research. However, the field of experimental design, grounded on black-box optimization, has been much less affected by such a paradigm shift, even though integrating LLMs with optimization presents a unique landscape ripe for exploration. In this position paper, we frame the field of black-box optimization around sequence-based foundation models and organize their relationship with previous literature. We discuss the most promising ways foundational language models can revolutionize optimization, which include harnessing the vast wealth of information encapsulated in free-form text to enrich task comprehension, utilizing highly flexible sequence models such as Transformers to engineer superior optimization strategies, and enhancing performance prediction over previously unseen search spaces.

Activation Patching is a method of directly computing these causal attributions, and is ubiquitous in mechanistic interpretability analyses. However, scaling it to many attributions requires a sweep with cost scales linear in the number of model components, which can be prohibitively expensive, involving millions to billions of forward passes in SoTA models. We propose to use Attribution Patching (AtP), a gradient-based approximation that runs in $O(1)$ passes, as a pre-filtering step to Activation Patching. We investigate the performance of AtP, finding two classes of failure modes which produce false negatives. We propose a variant of AtP called AtP, with two changes to address these failure modes while retaining scalability. We present the first systematic study of AtP and alternative methods for faster activation patching and show that AtP significantly outperforms all other investigated methods, with AtP providing further significant improvement. Finally, we provide a method to estimate the residual error of AtP* and bound the probability of remaining false negatives.

To this end, we introduce a programme of new ""dangerous capability"" evaluations and pilot them on Gemini models. These evaluations cover five topics: (1) persuasion & deception; (2) cyber-security; (3) self-proliferation; (4) self-reasoning & self-modification; and (5) biological and nuclear risk. We do not find evidence of strong dangerous capabilities in the models we evaluated, but we flag early warning signs. Our goal is to help lay the groundwork for a rigorous science of dangerous capability evaluation, in preparation for future, more capable models.

This scaling has been enabled by ever more heroic feats of engineering, necessary for accommodating ML approaches that require high bandwidth communication between devices working in parallel. In this work, we propose a co-designed modular architecture and training approach for ML models, dubbed DIstributed PAth COmposition (DiPaCo).   During training, DiPaCo  distributes computation by paths through a set of shared modules.  Together with a Local-SGD inspired optimization (DiLoCo) that keeps modules in sync with drastically reduced communication, our approach enables training across poorly connected and potentially heterogeneous workers. At test time, only a single path needs to be executed for each input, without the need for any  model compression.  We consider this approach as a first prototype towards a new paradigm of large-scale learning, one that is less synchronous and more modular. Our experiments on the widely used C4 benchmark show that for the same amount of training steps but less wall-clock time, DiPaCo exceeds the performance of a 1B dense transformer language model using 256 paths of size 150M.

The second assumes that a reward model trained on these pointwise rewards can generalize from collected data to out-of-distribution data sampled by the policy. Recently,  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is proposed as an approach that bypass the second approximation and learn directly a policy from collected data without the reward modelling stage. However, DPO still heavily relies on the first approximation. In this paper we try to gain a deeper theoretical understanding of these practical algorithms. In particular we derive a new generalized objective called $\Psi$PO for learning from human preferences that is expressed in terms of pairwise preferences and therefore bypasses both approximations.  This new general objective allows us to perform an in-depth analysis of the behavior of RLHF and DPO (as special cases of $\Psi$PO) and to identify their potential pitfalls.  We then consider another special case for $\Psi$PO  called Identity Preference Optimization (IPO) for which we can derive an efficient optimization procedure, prove performance guarantees and demonstrate the empirical performance on a synthetic example. Our in-depth analysis shows how DPO and RLHF can be  prone to over-training despite despite being regularized while IPO remains robust to over-training.

However, many existing approaches that measure the novelty of observations are brittle, or rely on restrictive assumptions about the environment which limit generality. We propose to decompose the exploration problem into two orthogonal sub-problems: (i) finding the right representation (metric) for exploration (ii) estimating densities in this representation space. To address (ii), we introduce Robust Exploration via Clustering-based Online Density Estimation (RECODE), a non-parametric method that estimates visitation counts for clusters of states that are similar according to the metric induced by any arbitrary representation learning technique. We adapt classical clustering algorithms to design a new type of memory that allows RECODE to keep track of the history of interactions over thousands of episodes, thus effectively tracking global visitation counts. This is in contrast to existing non-parametric approaches, that can only store the recent history, typically the current episode. %The resulting exploration bonus is simpler, more principled, and shown to be more robust than existing approaches on challenging tasks. The generality of RECODE allows us to easily address (i) by leveraging both off-the-shelf and novel representation learning techniques. In particular, we introduce a novel generalization of the action-prediction representation that leverages multi-step predictions and that we find to be better suited to a suite of challenging 3D-exploration tasks in \DMH. We show experimentally that our approach can work with a variety of RL agents, and obtain state-of-the-art performance on Atari and \DMH.

AI safety via debate [Irving et al. 2018] is a notable proposal in this direction with the goal of pitting the power of such AI models against each other until the (mis)-alignment identification problem is broken down into a manageable sub-task. While the promise of this approach is clear, the original framework was based on the assumption that the honest strategy is able to simulate deterministic AI systems for an exponential number of steps, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we show how to address these challenges by designing a new set of debate protocols where the honest strategy can always succeed using a simulation of a polynomial number of steps, whilst being able to verify the alignment of stochastic AI systems, even when the dishonest strategy is allowed to use exponentially many simulation steps.

This poses great challenges given the high correlation between consecutive video frames and there is very little prior work on it. Our framework allows us to do a first deep dive into the topic and includes a collection of streams and tasks composed from two existing video datasets, plus methodology for performance evaluation that considers both adaptation and generalization. We employ pixel-to-pixel modelling as a practical and flexible way to switch between pre-training and single-stream evaluation as well as between arbitrary tasks, without ever requiring changes to models and always using the same pixel loss. Equipped with this framework we obtained large single-stream learning gains from pre-training with a novel family of future prediction tasks, found that momentum hurts, and that the pace of weight updates matters. The combination of these insights leads to matching the performance of IID learning with batch size 1, when using the same architecture and without costly replay buffers.

We  present  aneffective  yet  simple  framework  to  extend  the  use  of  replay  data  across  experi-ments,  minimally adapting the RL engineering workflow for sizeable improve-ments in controller performance.  At its core, Replay across Experiments (RaE)involves reusing experience from previous experiments to improve exploration,bootstrap learning and ultimately obtain stronger performance.  We empiricallydemonstrate the robustness and benefits of our approach on a number of RL algo-rithms and challenging control domains spanning both locomotion and manipu-lation including sparsely rewarded tasks with egocentric vision. Furthermore, wedemonstrate how RaE can be leveraged in settings with available existing offlinedatasets to achieve state-of-the-art performance.   Finally,  through various abla-tions we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to the underlying algorithm,quality and amount of data available and various hyperparameter choices.

However, for generating strings from highly structured languages (e.g., semantic parsing to complex domain-specific languages), it is challenging for the LLM to generalize from just a few exemplars. We propose \emph{grammar prompting}, a simple approach to enable LLMs to use external knowledge and domain-specific constraints, expressed through a grammar in Backus--Naur Form (BNF), during in-context learning. Grammar prompting augments each demonstration example with a specialized grammar that is minimally sufficient for generating the particular output example, where the specialized grammar is a subset of the full DSL grammar. For inference, the LLM first predicts a BNF grammar given a test input, and then generates the output according to the rules of the grammar. Experiments demonstrate that grammar prompting can enable LLMs to perform competitively on a diverse set of DSL generation tasks, including semantic parsing (SMCalFlow, Overnight, GeoQuery), PDDL planning, and SMILES-based molecule generation.

Newly expanded context windows allow us to investigate ICL with hundreds or thousands of examples – the many-shot regime. Going from few-shot to many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety of generative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can be bottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated outputs. To mitigate this limitation, we explore two new settings: “Reinforced ICL” and “Unsupervised ICL”. Reinforced ICL uses model-generated chain-of-thought rationales in place of human rationales. Unsupervised ICL removes rationales from the prompt altogether, and prompts the model only with domain-specific inputs. We find that both Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL can be quite effective in the many-shot regime, particularly on complex reasoning tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that, unlike few-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretraining biases and can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs. Our analysis also reveals the limitations of next-token prediction loss as an indicator of downstream performance. Authors Rishabh Agarwal, Avi Singh, Lei M.

A cross-disciplinary group of practitioners and scholars from computer science and law convened to discuss the technical, doctrinal, and policy challenges presented by law for generative AI, and by generative AI for law, with an emphasis on US law in particular. We conclude that there is an essential need for 1) a shared knowledge base that provides a common conceptual language for experts across disciplines; 2) clarification of the distinctive technical capabilities of generative-AI systems as compared and contrasted to other computer and AI systems; 3) a logical taxonomy of the legal issues these systems raise; and, 4) a concrete research agenda to promote collaboration and knowledge-sharing on emerging issues at the intersection of generative AI and law. In this report, we synthesize the key takeaways from the GenLaw workshop that begin to address these four needs. Authors A.

In this paper, we propose a three-layered framework toward a structured, sociotechnical approach to evaluate these risks. The approach here evolves from a system safety perspective, particularly the insight that context determines whether a given capability causes harm. Applied to AI, this perspective shows that evaluation at multiple layers of analysis is required in order to assess whether or not an AI system may cause a given harm. Sociotechnical evaluation begins with the main current approach to safety evaluation, capability testing, which considers AI system outputs and their components in isolation. Building on this, it accounts for two further layers of context. The second layer centres the human interacting with a system to assess harm that may occur at the point of use. Broader systemic impacts on the structures into which an AI system is embedded require evaluation at the third, systemic evaluation layer. The second main contribution of this paper is an overview of the current state of sociotechnical evaluation. Reviewing all available evaluations for social and ethical risks known to a wide range of cross-industry researchers, we map gaps in the status quo. We then carefully lay out a roadmap of tractable steps toward closing the identified gaps.

Yet converging evidence in behavior, neuroscience and evolution shows that natural intelligence emerged at multiple scales in networks of interacting agents. For those interested in reverse-engineering intelligence, these findings suggest constraints on the space of workable algorithms. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) run parallel to these findings, with specific population structures enabling agents to master complex strategic games like Capture-The-Flag and StarCraft II. We posit that moving beyond a solipsistic view of agency will benefit both cognitive science and machine learning: understanding intelligence demands a multi-agent context. Authors Edgar A.

How do animals solve the social dilemmas they face in coordinating with a partner? We developed an evolutionary model to explore this question, based on observations that a) neuroendocrine feedback provides emotional bookkeeping which is thought to play a key role in vertebrate social bonds and b) these bonds are developed and maintained via courtship interactions that include low-stakes social dilemmas. Using agent-based simulation, we found that emotional bookkeeping and courtship sustained cooperation in the iterated prisoner’s dilemma in noisy environments, especially when combined. However, when deceitful defection was possible at low cost, courtship often increased cooperation, whereas emotional bookkeeping decreased it. Authors Suzanne Sadedin, Edgar A. Duéñez-Guzmán, Joel Z.

However, standard approaches to training LLM require a large number of tightly interconnected accelerators, with devices exchanging gradients and other intermediate states at each optimization step.  While it is difficult to build and maintain a single computing cluster hosting many accelerators, it might be easier to find several computing clusters each hosting a smaller number of devices.  In this work, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm, Distributed Low-Communication (DiLoCo), that enables training of language models on islands of devices that are poorly connected. The approach is a variant of federated averaging, where the number of inner steps is large, the inner optimizer is AdamW, and  the outer optimizer is Nesterov momentum. On the widely used C4 dataset, we show that DiLoCo on 8 workers performs as well as fully synchronous optimization while communicating 500 times less. DiLoCo exhibits great robustness to the data distribution of each worker.  It is also robust to resources becoming unavailable over time, and vice versa, it can seamlessly leverage resources that become available during training.

It is natural to apply Bayesian probabilistic inference to the uncertain parameters and, since the goal of the agent is to find the optimal policy, a relevant object of study is the posterior probability of optimality for each state-action. Previous work on `RL as inference' has equipped the agent with a surrogate potential in order to estimate this quantity, however the approximation can be arbitrarily poor, leading to algorithms that do not perform well in practice. In this work, we rigorously analyze how the posterior probability of optimality flows through the Markov decision process (MDP) and show that sampling according to this probability yields a guaranteed Bayesian regret bound. In practice computing this probability is intractable, so we derive a variational Bayesian approximation yielding a tractable convex optimization problem and show that the resulting policy also satisfies a Bayesian regret bound. We call our approach VAPOR and show that it has deep connections to Thompson sampling, K-learning, information theory, and maximum entropy exploration.

We derive several new algorithms for dynamic programming and temporal-difference learning based on this framework, provide asymptotic convergence the-ory, and examine the empirical performance of the algorithms on a suite of tabulartasks.   Further,  we show that this approach can be straightforwardly combinedwith deep reinforcement learning, and obtain a new deep RL agent that improvesover baseline distributional approaches on the Arcade Learning Environment.

Traditionally employed for generating images, we repurpose this model to learn semantically consistent key points across diverse image datasets. Our method involves adding noise to the input image, simulating the denoising process, and subsequently extracting the attention maps. From these attention maps, we select the k sharpest ones, subjecting them to further sharpening to enhance precision. Additionally, we introduce an equivariance constraint ensuring that the learned key points remain consistent even under various image transformations. Notably, our approach demonstrates superior performance over competing methods, particularly excelling in non-aligned data, showcasing its potential in accurately identifying and retaining semantically meaningful key points across images.

This question is salient given recent successes of passively-trained language models in interactive domains such as tool use. Passive learning is inherently limited. However, we show that purely passive learning can in fact allow an agent to learn generalizable strategies for determining and using causal structures, as long as the agent can intervene at test time. We formally illustrate that learning a strategy of first experimenting, then seeking goals, can allow generalization from passive learning in principle. We then show empirically that agents trained via imitation on expert data can indeed generalize at test time to infer and use causal links which are never present in the training data; these agents can also generalize experimentation strategies to novel variable sets never observed in training. We then show that strategies for causal intervention and exploitation can be generalized from passive data even in a more complex environment with high-dimensional observations, with the support of natural language explanations. Explanations can even allow passive learners to generalize out-of-distribution from perfectly-confounded training data. Finally, we show that language models, trained only on passive next-word prediction, can generalize causal intervention strategies from a few-shot prompt containing explanations and reasoning. These results highlight the surprising power of passive learning of active causal strategies, and have implications for understanding the behaviors and capabilities of language models.

We propose a novel benchmark focused on assessing inferential properties of statements with spatial prepositions. The benchmark includes original datasets in English and Romanian and aims to probe the limits of reasoning about spatial relations in large language models. We use prompt engineering to study the performance of two families of large language models, PaLM and GPT-3, on our benchmark. Our results show considerable variability in the performance of smaller and larger models, as well as across prompts and languages. However, none of the models reaches human performance.

This is especially the case for languages other than English, where human evaluations are scarce. In this work, we introduce SEAHORSE, a dataset for multilingual, multifaceted summarization evaluation. SEAHORSE consists of 96K summaries with human ratings along 6 dimensions of text quality: comprehensibility, repetition, grammar, attribution, main ideas, and conciseness, covering 6 languages, 9 systems, and 4 datasets. As a result of its size and scope, SEAHORSE can serve both as a benchmark to evaluate learnt metrics, as well as a large-scale resource for training such metrics. We show that metrics trained with SEAHORSE achieve strong performance on the out-of-domain meta-evaluation benchmarks TRUE (Honovich et al., 2022) and mFACE (Aharoni et al., 2022). We make the SEAHORSE dataset and metrics publicly available for future research on multilingual and multifaceted summarization evaluation.

This yields as the optimal preconditioning an inverse Fisher information covariance matrix, where the covariance matrix is computed as the outer product of log target gradients averaged under the target. We apply this result to the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and derive a computationally efficient adaptive MCMC scheme that learns the preconditioning from the history of gradients produced as the algorithm runs. We show in several experiments that the proposed algorithm is very robust in high dimensions and significantly outperforms other methods, including a closely related adaptive MALA scheme that learns the preconditioning with standard adaptive MCMC as well as the position-dependent Riemannian manifold MALA sampler.

Our central insight is that since language is often used to describe physical interaction, large pretrained text-based models can act as priors on pose estimation. We can thus leverage this insight to improve pose estimation by converting natural language descriptors, generated by a large multimodal model (LMM), into tractable losses to constrain the 3D pose optimization. Despite its simplicity, our method produces surprisingly compelling pose reconstructions of people in close contact, correctly capturing the semantics of the social and physical interactions. We demonstrate that our method rivals more complex state-of-the-art approaches that require expensive human annotation of contact points and training specialized models. Moreover, unlike previous approaches, our method provides a unified framework for resolving self-contact and person-to-person contact.

Computer vision, in contrast, has largely stayed in the former regime: specialized decoders and finetuning protocols are generally required to perform dense tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation. In this work we explore a simple mechanism for in-context learning of such scene understanding tasks: nearest neighbor retrieval from a prompt of annotated features. We propose a new pretraining protocol—leveraging attention within and across images—which yields representations particularly useful in this regime. The resulting Hummingbird model, suitably prompted, performs various scene understanding tasks without modification while approaching the performance of specialists that have been finetuned for each task. Moreover, Hummingbird can be configured to perform new tasks much more efficiently than finetuned models, raising the possibility of scene understanding in the interactive assistant regime.

The model incorporates a conditional visual encoder, which distills an input image into a compact representation, that, in turn, guides the generation of novel views of the input's content. We show that imposing a tight bottleneck between the visual encoder and the denoising decoder, in the form of a sole embedding through which they can communicate, turns diffusion models into strong and efficient representation learners, capable of capturing and predicting images' semantic properties in an unsupervised manner, as we demonstrate by attaining high performance on varied classification, reconstruction and synthesis tasks over a wide array of datasets ranging from CelebA to ShapeNet to ImageNet. Further investigation of the model's generative qualities reveals the disentangled nature of its emerging latent space, which serves as an effective interface to control and manipulate the produced outputs, so to create diverse views and variations. All in all, we aim to shed light on the exciting and promising potential of diffusion models, not only for image generation, but also for learning rich and robust representations. Authors Drew A.

Although critical to the learning process, this value is typically not adjusted when proposing new algorithms. In this work we present a broad empirical study that suggests reducing the batch size can result in a number of significant performance gains; this is surprising, as the general tendency when training neural networks is towards larger batch sizes for improved performance. We complement our experimental findings with a set of empirical analyses towards better understanding this phenomenon. Authors Johan Obando Ceron, Marc G.

The agent can use its experience in each task \emph{and} across tasks to estimate both the transition model and the distribution over tasks. We propose an algorithm to meta-learn the underlying relatedness across tasks, utilize it to plan in each task, and upper-bound the regret of the planning loss. Our bound suggests that the average regret over tasks decreases as the number of tasks increases and as the tasks are more similar. In the classical single-task setting, it is known that the planning horizon should depend on the estimated model's accuracy, that is, on the number of samples within task. We generalize this finding to meta-RL and study this dependence of planning horizon on the number of tasks. Based on our theoretical findings, we derive heuristics for selecting slowly increasing discount factors, and validate its significance empirically.

However, current methods for evaluating such models remain incomplete: standard likelihood-based metrics do not always apply and rarely correlate with perceptual fidelity, while sample-based metrics, such as FID, are insensitive to overfitting, i.e., inability to generalize beyond the training set. To address these limitations, we propose a new metric called the Feature Likelihood Divergence (FLD), a parametric sample-based score that uses density estimation to provide a comprehensive trichotomic evaluation accounting for novelty (i.e., different from the training samples), fidelity, and diversity of generated samples. We empirically demonstrate the ability of FLD to identify specific overfitting problem cases, where previously proposed metrics fail. We also extensively evaluate FLD on various image datasets and model classes, demonstrating its ability to match intuitions of previous metrics like FID while offering a more comprehensive evaluation of generative models.

Inspired by recent advances in foundation models for vision and language, we propose a foundation agent for robotic manipulation. This agent, named RoboCat, is a visual goal-conditioned decision transformer capable of consuming multi-embodiment action-labelled visual experience. This data spans a large repertoire of motor control skills from simulated and real robotic arms with varying sets of observations and actions. With RoboCat, we demonstrate the ability to generalise to new tasks and robots, both zero-shot as well as through adaptation using only 100--1000 examples for the target task. We also show how a trained model itself can be used to generate data for subsequent training iterations, thus providing a basic building block for an autonomous improvement loop. We investigate the agent's capabilities, with large-scale evaluations both in simulation and on three different real robot embodiments. We find that as we grow and diversify its training data, RoboCat not only shows signs of cross-task transfer, but also becomes more efficient at adapting to new tasks.

The scope of this research method is now poised to grow dramatically as it absorbs the new affordances provided by Large Language Models (LLM)s. Generative Agent-Based Models (GABM) are not just classic Agent-Based Models (ABM)s where the agents talk to one another. Rather, GABMs are constructed using an LLM to apply common sense to situations, act ""reasonably"", recall common semantic knowledge, produce API calls to control digital technologies like apps, and communicate both within the simulation and to researchers viewing it from the outside. Here we present Concordia, a library to facilitate constructing and working with GABMs. Concordia makes it easy to construct language-mediated simulations of physically- or digitally-grounded environments. Concordia agents produce their behavior using a flexible component system which mediates between two fundamental operations: LLM calls and associative memory retrieval. A special agent called the Game Master (GM), which was inspired by tabletop role-playing games, is responsible for simulating the environment where the agents interact. Agents take actions by describing what they want to do in natural language. The GM then translates their actions into appropriate implementations. In a simulated physical world, the GM checks the physical plausibility of agent actions and describes their effects. In digital environments simulating technologies such as apps and services, the GM may handle API calls to integrate with external tools such as general AI assistants (e.g., Bard, ChatGPT), and digital apps (e.g., Calendar, Email, Search, etc.). Concordia was designed to support a wide array of applications both in scientific research and for evaluating performance of real digital services by simulating users and/or generating synthetic data.

Our approach, rooted in Research through Design (RtD), examines the application of prosody in directing a quadruped robot navigation. We involved ten team members in an experiment to command a robot through an obstacle course using natural interaction. A human operator, serving as the robot's sensory and processing proxy, translated these interactions into navigation commands, effectively simulating an intuitive interface. During our analysis of interaction videos, where lexical and visual cues proved insufficient for accurate command interpretation, we turned to non-verbal auditory cues. Qualitative evidence suggests that participants intuitively relied on prosody to control the robot navigation. This paper discusses specific distinct prosodic constructs that emerged from our analysis and their functions. Our findings highlight prosody as a multifunctional communicative signal offering substantial potential for intuitive robotic interfaces.

However, self-consistency relies on the answer extraction process to aggregate multiple solutions, which is not applicable to free-form answers. In this work, we propose Universal Self-Consistency (USC), which leverages the large language model (LLM) to select the most consistent solution among multiple candidates. We evaluate USC on a variety of benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning, long-context summarization, and open-ended question answering. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K and MATH, USC matches the standard self-consistency performance without requiring the answer formats to be similar. Meanwhile, USC consistently improves the performance over greedy decoding on open-ended generation tasks.

However, current KD methods for auto-regressive sequence models suffer from distribution mismatch between output sequences seen during training and those generated by the student upon deployment. To address this issue, we introduce Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD). Instead of solely relying on a fixed set of output sequences, GKD trains the student on its self-generated output sequences by leveraging feedback from the teacher on such sequences. Unlike supervised KD approaches, GKD also offers the flexibility to employ alternative divergence measures between the student and teacher, which can be useful when the student lacks the expressivity to mimic the teacher's distribution. Furthermore, GKD facilitates the seamless integration of distillation with RL fine-tuning (RLHF). We demonstrate the efficacy of GKD for distilling auto-regressive language models on summarization, translation, and arithmetic reasoning tasks.

Several prior works have demonstrated that neural models are effective at guiding program synthesis searches. However, a common drawback of those approaches is the inability to handle iterative loops, higher-order functions, or lambda functions, thus limiting prior neural searches from synthesizing longer and more general programs. We address this gap by designing a search algorithm called LambdaBeam that can construct arbitrary lambda functions that compose operations within a given DSL. We create semantic vector representations of the execution behavior of the lambda functions and train a neural policy network to choose which lambdas to construct during search, and pass them as arguments to higher-order functions to perform looping computations. Our experiments show that LambdaBeam outperforms neural, symbolic, and LLM-based techniques in an integer list manipulation domain.

Classic reinforcement learning (RL) theories centre on learning the expectation of potential rewarding outcomes and explain a wealth of neural data in prefrontal cortex. Distributional RL, on the other hand, learns the full distribution of rewarding outcomes and better explains dopamine responses. Here we show distributional RL also better explains prefrontal cortical responses, suggesting it is a ubiquitous mechanism for reward-guided learning.

Challenges include the joint modeling of indoor and outdoor scenes, which often exhibit significantly different distributions of RGB and depth, and the depth-scale ambiguity due to unknown camera intrinsics. Recent work has proposed specialized multi-head architectures for jointly modeling indoor and outdoor scenes. In contrast, we advocate a generic, task-agnostic diffusion model, with several advancements such as log-scale depth parameterization to enable joint modeling of indoor and outdoor scenes, conditioning on the field-of-view (FOV) to handle scale ambiguity and synthetically augmenting FOV during training to generalize beyond the limited camera intrinsics in training datasets. Furthermore, by employing a more diverse training mixture than is common, and an efficient diffusion parameterization, our method, DMD (Diffusion for Metric Depth) achieves a 25% reduction in relative error (REL) on zero-shot indoor and 33% reduction on zero-shot outdoor datasets over the current SOTA using only a small number of denoising steps.

However, identifying these traits can be challenging due to the need for domain expertise, specialist knowledge, and context-specific insights, making the process time-consuming and difficult to scale. Our focus on studying officials from China’s Ming Dynasty is no exception. To tackle this challenge, we propose MingOfficial, a large-scale multi-modal dataset consisting of both structured (career records, annotated personnel types) and text (historical texts) data for 9,376 officials. We further couple the dataset with a a graph neural network (GNN) to combine both modalities in order to allow investigation of social structures and provide features to boost down-stream tasks. Experiments show that our proposed MingOfficial could enable exploratory analysis of official identities, and also significantly boost performance in tasks such as identifying nuance identities (e.g. civil officials holding military power) from 24.6% to 98.2% F1 score in hold-out test set. By making MingOfficial publicly available (see main text for the URL) as both a dataset and an interactive tool, we aim to stimulate further research into the role of social context and representation learning in identifying individual characteristics, and hope to provide inspiration for computational approaches in other fields beyond Chinese studies.

To benchmark a model's long-form factuality in open domains, we first use GPT-4 to generate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38 topics. We then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for long-form factuality through a method which we call Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE). SAFE utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into a set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a multi-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search and determining whether a fact is supported by the search results. Furthermore, we propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality. To do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response (precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter representing a user's preferred response length (recall). Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can achieve superhuman rating performance - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced human annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement cases, SAFE wins 76% of the time. At the same time, SAFE is more than 20 times cheaper than human annotators. We also benchmark thirteen language models on LongFact across four model families (Gemini, GPT, Claude, and PaLM-2), finding that larger language models generally achieve better long-form factuality. LongFact, SAFE, and all experimental code are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality.

This paper quantifies theoretically to what extent this extra information reduces RL's sample complexity. In particular, we study the demonstration-regularized reinforcement learning that leverages the expert demonstrations by KL-regularization for a policy learned by behavior cloning. Our findings reveal that using NE expert demonstrations enables the identification of an optimal policy at a sample complexity of order ˜(Poly(S,A,H)/(ε2NE)) in finite and ˜(Poly(d,H)/(ε2NE)) in linear Markov decision processes, where ε is the target precision, H the horizon, A the number of action, S the number of states in the finite case and d the dimension of the feature space in the linear case. As a by-product, we provide tight convergence guarantees for the behaviour cloning procedure under general assumptions on the policy classes. Additionally, we establish that demonstration-regularized methods are provably efficient for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this respect, we provide theoretical evidence showing the benefits of KL-regularization for RLHF in tabular and linear MDPs. Interestingly, we avoid pessimism injection by employing computationally feasible regularization to handle reward estimation uncertainty, thus setting our approach apart from the prior works.

We introduce Gaussian process probes (GPP), a unified and simple framework for probing and measuring uncertainty about concepts represented by models. As a Bayesian extension of linear probing methods, GPP asks what kind of distribution over classifiers (of concepts) is induced by the model. This distribution can be used to measure both what the model represents and how confident the probe is about what the model represents. GPP can be applied to any pre-trained model with vector representations of inputs (e.g., activations). It does not require access to training data, gradients, or the architecture. We validate GPP on datasets containing both synthetic and real images. Our experiments show it can (1) probe a model's representations of concepts even with a very small number of examples, (2) accurately measure both epistemic uncertainty (how confident the probe is) and aleatory uncertainty (how fuzzy the concepts are to the model), and (3) detect out of distribution data using those uncertainty measures as well as classic methods do. By using Gaussian processes to expand what probing can offer, GPP provides a data-efficient, versatile and uncertainty-aware tool for understanding and evaluating the capabilities of machine learning models.

We introduce the Gated Sparse Autoencoder (Gated SAE), which achieves a Pareto improvement over training with prevailing methods. In SAEs, the L1 penalty used to encourage sparsity introduces many undesirable biases, such as shrinkage -- systematic underestimation of feature activations. The key insight of Gated SAEs is to separate the functionality of (a) determining which directions to use and (b) estimating the magnitudes of those directions: this enables us to apply the L1 penalty only to the former, limiting the scope of undesirable side effects. Through training SAEs on LMs of up to 7B parameters we find that, in typical hyper-parameter ranges, Gated SAEs solve shrinkage, are similarly interpretable, and require half as many firing features to achieve comparable reconstruction fidelity.

We first show that it is possible to backpropagate the reward function gradient through the full sampling procedure, and that doing so achieves strong performance on a variety of rewards, outperforming reinforcement learning-based approaches. We then propose more efficient variants of DRaFT: DRaFT-K, which truncates backpropagation to only the last K steps of sampling, and DRaFT-LV, which obtains lower-variance gradient estimates for the case when K=1. We show that our methods work well for a variety of reward functions and can be used to substantially improve the aesthetic quality of images generated by Stable Diffusion 1.4. Finally, we draw connections between our approach and prior work, providing a unifying perspective on the design space of gradient-based fine-tuning algorithms.

Forecasts of the joint distribution of weather trajectories via spatio-temporally coherent ensembles have further importance: they provide a powerful tool for decision-making in complex and high-impact domains including energy system planning, transportation routing, flood forecasting and more. State-of-the-art ML forecast models for medium-range weather, however, are largely trained to produce deterministic forecasts which lose physical consistency at longer lead times. We introduce GenCast, a ML-based generative model for ensemble weather forecasting, trained from reanalysis data. It forecasts ensembles of trajectories for hundreds of weather variables, up to 15 days at 1 degree resolution globally, using under TC secs per ensemble member. We show that GenCast is more skilful than ENS, a top operational ensemble forecast, for TC% of TC verification targets, while maintaining good calibration and physically consistent power spectra.

In-context learning is seen as one of the main contributors to their success. Previous work has demonstrated that in-context learning can even solve non-trivial tasks such as supervised and reinforcement learning. We expand on this line of work by investigating the effect of in context learning when the context is presented in a sequential manner.  We find that the sequential presentation of related tasks leads to better in-context learning performance, thereby revealing that in-context learning can be used to create better in-context learning algorithms. We coin this phenomenon \emph{meta-in-context learning}. Multiple experiments reveal that meta-in-context learning adaptively modifies a large language model's priors over latent variables and that it adjusts its learning strategies. Finally, we extend our approach to a benchmark of real-world regression problems where we observe competitive performance to traditional learning algorithms. Taken together, our work improves our understanding of in-context learning and paves the way toward adapting large language models to the environment they are applied purely through meta-in-context learning rather than traditional fine-tuning.

In this paper we show how existing foundation models can be used to scale up the deployment of operational robots incompletely unseen scenarios with minimal human supervision.  We refer to this system as AutoRT, which runs on over 50 robots across multiple buildings, collecting 77k real robot episodes via both teleoperation and autonomously moving robots. Such “in-the-wild” data is significantly more diverse than previous robotic datasets collected in robot lab settings, and improves robotics policies when used in co-fine-tuning.  When combined with vision, large language models can propose novel instructions based on their environment and reason about autonomy tradeoffs and safety without finetuning, allowing orchestration of large scale robot fleets.  We further show how introducing LLMs and VLMs into data collection creates new forms of interaction for steering robot agents to collect more diverse data or data for specific settings.

However, these capabilities (driven by in-context learning) are limited to short-term interactions, where users' feedback remains relevant for only as long as it fits within the context size of the LLM, and can be forgotten over longer interactions. In this work, we investigate fine-tuning the robot code-writing LLMs, to remember their in-context interactions and improve their teachability i.e., how efficiently they adapt to human inputs (measured by average number of corrections before the user considers the task successful). Our key observation is that when human-robot interactions are formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (in which human language inputs are observations, and robot code outputs are actions), then training an LLM to complete previous interactions can be viewed as training a transition dynamics model -- that can be combined with classic robotics techniques such as model predictive control (MPC) to discover shorter paths to success. This gives rise to Language Model Predictive Control (LMPC), a framework that fine-tunes PaLM 2 to improve its teachability on 78 tasks across 5 robot embodiments -- improving non-expert teaching success rates of unseen tasks by 26.9% while reducing the average number of human corrections from 2.4 to 1.9. Experiments show that LMPC also produces strong meta-learners, improving the success rate of in-context learning new tasks on unseen robot embodiments and APIs by 31.5%.

However, this perspective is based on a restricted view of learning as finding a solution, rather than treating learning as endless adaptation. In contrast, continual reinforcement learning refers to the setting in which the best agents never stop learning. Despite the importance of continual reinforcement learning, the community lacks a simple definition of the problem that highlights its commitments and makes its primary concepts precise and clear. To this end, this paper is dedicated to carefully defining the continual reinforcement learning problem. We formalize the notion of agents that ""never stop learning"" through a new mathematical language for analyzing and cataloging agents. Using this new language, we define a continual learning agent as one that can be understood as carrying out an implicit search process indefinitely, and continual reinforcement learning as the setting in which the best agents are all continual learning agents. We provide two motivating examples, illustrating that traditional views of multi-task reinforcement learning and continual supervised learning are special cases of our definition. Collectively, these definitions and perspectives formalize many intuitive concepts at the heart of learning, and open new research pathways surrounding continual learning agents.

To address these limitations, we propose ReadAgent, an LLM agent system that increases effective context length up to 20x in our experiments. Inspired by how humans interactively read long documents, we implement ReadAgent as a simple prompting system that uses the advanced language capabilities of LLMs to (1) decide what content to store together in a memory episode, (2) compress those memory episodes into short episodic memories called gist memories, and (3) take actions to look up passages in the original text if ReadAgent needs to remind itself of relevant details to complete a task. We evaluate ReadAgent against baselines using retrieval methods, using the original long contexts, and using the gist memories. These evaluations are performed on three long-document reading comprehension tasks: QuALITY, NarrativeQA, and QMSum. ReadAgent outperforms the baselines on all three tasks while extending the effective context window by 3-20x.

However, their non-linear scoring function cannot be scaled to millions of documents, necessitating a three-stage process for inference: retrieving initial candidates via token retrieval, accessing all token vectors, and scoring the initial candidate documents. The non-linear scoring function is applied over all token vectors of each candidate document, making the inference process complicated and slow. In this paper, we aim to simplify the multi-vector retrieval by rethinking the role of token retrieval. We present XTR, ConteXtualized Token Retriever, which introduces a simple, yet novel, objective function that encourages the model to retrieve the most important document tokens first. The improvement to token retrieval allows XTR to rank candidates only using the retrieved tokens rather than all tokens in the document, and enables a newly designed scoring stage that is two-to-three orders of magnitude cheaper than that of ColBERT. On the popular BEIR benchmark, XTR advances the state-of-the-art by 2.8 nDCG@10 without any distillation. Detailed analysis confirms our decision to revisit the token retrieval stage, as XTR demonstrates much better recall of the token retrieval stage compared to ColBERT.

Yet the mechanisms that underlie it are poorly understood. In this paper, we demonstrate that comparable ICL capabilities can be acquired by an alternative sequence prediction learning method using clone-structured causal graphs (CSCGs). Moreover, a key property of CSCGs is that, unlike transformer-based LLMs, they are {\em interpretable}, which considerably simplifies the task of explaining how ICL works. Specifically, we show that it uses a combination of (a) learning template (schema) circuits for pattern completion, (b) retrieving relevant templates in a context-sensitive manner, and (c) rebinding of novel tokens to appropriate slots in the templates. We go on to marshall evidence for the hypothesis that similar mechanisms underlie ICL in LLMs. For example, we find that, with CSCGs as with LLMs, different capabilities emerge at different levels of overparameterization, suggesting that overparameterization helps in learning more complex template (schema) circuits. By showing how ICL can be achieved with small models and datasets, we open up a path to novel architectures, and take a vital step towards a more general understanding of the mechanics behind this important capability.

The idea behind unsupervised knowledge elicitation is that knowledge satisfies a consistency structure, which can be used to discover knowledge. We first prove theoretically that arbitrary features (not just knowledge) satisfy the consistency structure of a particular leading unsupervised knowledge-elicitation method, contrast-consistent search (Burns et al., 2023). We then present a series of experiments showing  settings in which unsupervised methods result in classifiers that do not predict knowledge, but instead predict a different prominent feature. We conclude that existing unsupervised methods for discovering latent knowledge are insufficient, and we contribute sanity checks to apply to evaluating future knowledge elicitation methods. Conceptually, we hypothesise that the identification issues explored here, e.g. distinguishing a model's knowledge from that of a simulated character's, will persist for future unsupervised methods.

Our learned rates are then applied to guide a single silicon atom throughout the lattice to pre-determined target destinations. We present sensitivity and accuracy analyses that demonstrate the generality of our approach.

The model can be prompted to generate an endless variety of action-controllable virtual worlds described through text, synthetic images, photographs, and even sketches. At 11B parameters, Genie can be considered a foundation world model. It is comprised of a spatiotemporal video tokenizer, an autoregressive dynamics model, and a simple and scalable latent action model. Genie enables users to act in the generated environments on a frame-by-frame basis despite training without any ground-truth action labels or other domain-specific requirements typically found in the world model literature. Further the resulting learned latent action space facilitates training agents to imitate behaviors from unseen videos, opening the path for training generalist agents of the future.

We build on recent advances in generative modeling that turn text-to-image models into classifiers. This allows us to study their behavior and to compare them against discriminative models and human psychophysical data. We report four intriguing emergent properties of diffusion-based generative classifiers: they show a record-breaking human-like shape bias (99% for Imagen), near human-level out-of-distribution accuracy, state-of-the-art alignment with human classification errors, and they understand certain perceptual illusions. Our results indicate that while the current dominant paradigm for modeling human object recognition is discriminative inference, zero-shot generative models approximate human object recognition data surprisingly well.

This class is known to be more general than  linear MDPs, where the transition kernel and the reward function are assumed to be linear functions of the feature vectors. As our first contribution, we show that the difference between the two classes is the presence of states in linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs where for any policy, all the actions have  approximately equal values, and skipping over these states by following an arbitrarily fixed policy in those states transforms the problem to a linear MDP. Based on this observation, we derive a novel (computationally inefficient) learning algorithm for linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs that simultaneously learns what states should be skipped over and runs another learning algorithm on the linear MDP hidden in the problem. The method returns an $\epsilon$-optimal policy after $\text{polylog}(H, d)/\epsilon^2$ interactions with the MDP, where $H$ is the time horizon and $d$ is the dimension of the feature vectors, giving the first polynomial-sample-complexity online RL algorithm for this setting. The results are proved for the misspecified case, where the sample complexity is shown to degrade gracefully with the misspecification error.

The next frontier is real-world scenarios, where setups are numerous and varied. For this, agents need to learn the underlying environment dynamics, so as to robustly generalise to conditions that differ from those they were trained on. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms, such as MuZero or Dreamer, aim to accomplish this by learning a world model. However, leveraging a world model has not yet consistently shown greater generalisation capabilities compared to model-free alternatives. In this work, we propose improving the data efficiency and generalisation capabilities of MuZero by explicitly incorporating the symmetries of the environment in its world-model architecture. We prove that, so long as the neural networks used by MuZero are equivariant to a particular symmetry group acting on the environment, the entirety of MuZero's action-selection algorithm will also be equivariant to that group. As such, Equivariant MuZero is guaranteed to behave symmetrically in symmetrically-transformed states, and will hence be more data-efficient when learning its world models. We evaluate Equivariant MuZero on procedurally-generated MiniPacman and on Chaser from the ProcGen suite: training on a set of mazes, and then testing on unseen rotated versions, demonstrating the benefits of equivariance. We verify that our improvements hold even when only some of the components of Equivariant MuZero obey strict equivariance, which highlights the robustness of our construction.

Cooperative game theory has many applications, ranging from analyzing power in decision making bodies and politics to predicting how human teams might decide to share profits achieved jointly. Another recent application of cooperative games in machine learning is explainable AI (XAI), and in particular identifying the key features or data points that were most influential on the predictions made by a black box model. Recent research has applied the Shapley value for these purposes, as it can be approximated using fast random algorithms. In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms for approximating the core in coalitional games, that iteratively refine a payoff vector by sampling the constraints posed by randomly selected coalitions. By overcoming the computational barrier, we show how the core can provide a desirable alternative to the Shapley value for many applications: political power analysis, predicting individual payoffs in human teams and explainable AI. Our empirical analysis shows how team stability is affected by game parameters for important classes of cooperative games (weighted voting games, graph games and marginal contribution networks). Further, we contrast the individual impact estimates of the Shapley value and the least-core in political settings and explainable AI analysis of multiple datasets.

In this work, we propose a novel method to alleviate these problems that we call odd-$k$-out learning (OKO), which minimizes the cross-entropy error for sets rather than for single examples. This naturally allows the model to capture correlations across data examples and achieves both better accuracy and calibration, especially in limited training data and class-imbalanced regimes. Perhaps surprisingly, OKO often yields better calibration even when training with hard labels and dropping any additional calibration parameter tuning, such as temperature scaling. We provide theoretical justification, establishing that OKO naturally yields better calibration, and provide extensive experimental analyses that corroborate our theoretical findings. We emphasize that OKO is a general framework that can be easily adapted to many settings and the trained model can be applied to single examples at inference time, without introducing significant run-time overhead or architecture changes.

However, the objectives used to train these networks enforce only that similar images are embedded at similar locations in the representation space, and do not directly constrain the global structure of the resulting space. Here, we explore the impact of supervising this global structure by linearly aligning it with human similarity judgments. We find that a naive approach leads to large changes in local representational structure that harm downstream performance. Thus, we propose a novel method that aligns the global structure of representations while preserving their local structure. This global-local transform considerably improves accuracy across a variety of few-shot learning and anomaly detection tasks. Our results indicate that human visual representations are globally organized in a way that facilitates learning from few examples, and incorporating this global structure into neural network representations improves performance on downstream tasks.

Most recent works frame it as a reinforcement learning problem, where a reward function is learned from pairwise preference data and the LLM is treated as a policy which is adapted to maximize the rewards, often under additional regularization constraints. We propose an alternative interpretation which centers on the generative process for pairwise preferences and treats LHF as a density estimation problem. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing that for a family of generative processes defined via preference behavior distribution equations, training a reward function on pairwise preferences effectively models an annotator's implicit preference distribution. Finally, we discuss and present findings on ""annotator misspecification""—failure cases where wrong modeling assumptions are made about annotator behavior, resulting in poorly-adapted models—suggesting that approaches that learn from pairwise human preferences could have trouble learning from a population of annotators with diverse viewpoints.

Does it, or could it, ever make sense to speak of AI agents built out of generative language models in terms of consciousness, given that they are ""mere"" simulacra of human behaviour, and that what they do can be seen as ""merely"" role play? Drawing on the later writing of Wittgenstein, this paper attempts to tackle this question while avoiding the pitfalls of dualistic thinking.

Active learning methods aim to increase data efficiency by prioritizing learning on the most relevant examples. Despite their appeal, these methods have yet to be widely adopted since no one algorithm has been shown to a) generalize across models and tasks b) scale to large datasets and c) yield overall FLOP savings when accounting for the overhead of data selection. In this work we propose a method which satisfies these three properties, leveraging small, cheap proxy models to estimate ""learnability"" scores for datapoints, which are used to prioritize data for the training of much larger models. As a result, our models require 46% and 51% fewer training updates and up to 25% less total computation to reach the same performance as uniformly trained visual classifiers on JFT and multimodal models on ALIGN. Finally, we find our data-prioritization scheme to be complementary with recent data-curation and learning objectives, yielding a new state-of-the-art in several multimodal transfer tasks.

But this is difficult for generative models because probabilistic predictions do not distinguish between per-response noise (aleatoric uncertainty) and lack of knowledge about the process (epistemic uncertainty), and existing epistemic uncertainty quantification techniques tend to be overconfident when the model underfits. We propose a general strategy for teaching a model to both approximate $p(Y|X)$ and also estimate the remaining gaps between ${\widehat{p}}_{\theta}(Y|X)$ and $p(Y|X)$: train it to predict pairs of independent responses drawn from the true conditional distribution, allow it to ""cheat"" by observing one response while predicting the other, then measure how much it cheats. Remarkably, we prove that being good at cheating (i.e. cheating whenever it improves your prediction) is equivalent to being second-order calibrated, a principled extension of ordinary calibration that allows us to construct provably-correct frequentist confidence intervals for $p(Y|X)$ and detect incorrect responses with high probability. We demonstrate empirically that our approach accurately estimates how much models don't know across ambiguous image classification, (synthetic) language modeling, and partially-observable navigation tasks, outperforming existing techniques.

For that, we develop AlphaTensor-Quantum, a method based on deep reinforcement learning that exploits the relationship between optimizing T-count and tensor decomposition. Unlike existing methods for T-count optimization, AlphaTensor-Quantum can incorporate domain-specific knowledge about quantum computation and leverage gadgets, which significantly reduces the T-count of the optimized circuits. AlphaTensor-Quantum outperforms all existing methods for T-count optimization on a set of arithmetic benchmarks. Remarkably, it rediscovers an efficient multiplication algorithm akin to Karatsuba's method for multiplication in finite fields, and it finds the best human-designed solutions for relevant arithmetic computations used in Shor's algorithm and for quantum chemistry simulation. Thus, AlphaTensor-Quantum can save hundreds of hours of research by optimizing relevant quantum circuits in a fully automated way.

We also point out that several mathematical tasks that are at the core of the so-called compositional tasks thought to be hard for LLMs are unlikely to be solvable by Transformers, for large enough instances and assuming that certain well accepted conjectures in the field of Computational Complexity are true.

However, transferring these models to new tasks involves expensive (full) finetuning. One efficient method is to cache features by processing a dataset through a pretrained model and subsequently train a small network on the cached features. How to effectively incorporate data augmentation on top of such cached features is an open question. In this paper, we extensively study frozen feature augmentation (FroFA) in the few-shot setting. We focus on the low-data regime as we assume to observe significant effects. Our study includes eighteen data augmentations, four network architectures, two large pretraining datasets and three transfer datasets. Our results indicate that some commonly used image data augmentations also transfer to the feature space.

This construction allows us to deploy standard non-convex stochastic optimization techniques for approximating Nash equilibria, resulting in novel algorithms with provable guarantees. We complement our theoretical analysis with experiments demonstrating that stochastic gradient descent can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches.

To fill this gap, we conduct systematic experiments studying whether and how different scaling factors, including LLM model size, pretraining data size, new finetuning parameter size and finetuning data size, affect the finetuning performance. We consider two types of finetuning – full-model tuning (FMT) and parameter efficient tuning (PET, including prompt tuning and LoRA), and explore their scaling behaviors in the data-limited regime where the LLM model size substantially outweighs the finetuning data size. Based on two sets of pretrained bilingual LLMs from 1B to 16B and experiments on bilingual machine translation and multilingual summarization benchmarks, we find that 1) LLM finetuning follows a power-based multiplicative joint scaling law between finetuning data size and each other scaling factor; 2) LLM finetuning benefits more from LLM model scaling than pretraining data scaling, and PET parameter scaling is generally ineffective; and 3) the optimal finetuning method is highly task- and finetuning data-dependent. We hope our findings could shed light on understanding, selecting and developing LLM finetuning methods.

Published 2 March 2024    View publication      Download                   Share                                                  Copy link                   ×                          Abstract In recent years, various methods and benchmarks have been proposed to empirically evaluate the alignment of artificial neural networks to human neural and behavioral data. But how aligned are different alignment metrics? To answer this question, we here analyze visual data from Brain-Score (Schrimpf et al., 2018), including metrics from the model-vs-human toolbox (Geirhos et al., 2021), together with human feature alignment (Linsley et al., 2018; Fel et al., 2022) and human similarity judgements (Muttenthaler et al., 2022). We find that pairwise correlations between neural scores and behavioral scores are quite low and sometimes even negative. For instance, the average correlation between those 95 models on Brain-Score that were fully evaluated on all 51 alignment metrics is only 0.161. Assuming that all of the employed metrics are sound, this implies that alignment with human perception may best be thought of as a multidimensional concept, with different methods measuring fundamentally different aspects. Our results underline the importance of integrative benchmarking, but also raise questions about how to correctly combine and aggregate individual metrics. Aggregating by taking the arithmetic average, as done in Brain-Score, leads to the overall performance currently being dominated by behavior (81.24% explained variance) while the neural predictivity plays a less important role (only 67.31% explained variance). As a first step towards making sure that different alignment metrics all contribute towards aggregated scores, we therefore conclude by comparing three different aggregation options.

However, there are still significant drawbacks compared to traditional feedback control approaches for magnetic confinement. In this work, we address key drawbacks of the RL method; achieving higher control accuracy for desired plasma properties, reducing the steady-state error, and decreasing the required time to learn new tasks. We build on top of Degrave et al. (2022), and present algorithmic improvements to the agent architecture and training procedure. We present simulation results that show up to 65% improvement in shape accuracy, achieve substantial reduction in the long-term bias of the plasma current, and additionally reduce the training time required to learn new tasks by a factor of 3 or more. We present new experiments using the upgraded RL-based controllers on the TCV tokamak, which validate the simulation results achieved, and point the way towards routinely achieving accurate discharges using the RL approach.

These include regular RPE techniques applied for nongeometric data, as well as novel RPEs operating on the sequences of tokens embedded in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces (e.g. point clouds). FLTs construct the optimal RPE mechanism implicitly by learning its spectral representation. As opposed to other architectures combining efficient low-rank linear attention with RPEs, FLTs remain practical in terms of their memory usage and do not require additional assumptions about the structure of the RPE-mask. FLTs allow also for applying certain structural inductive bias techniques to specify masking strategies, e.g. they provide a way to learn the so-called local RPEs introduced in this paper and providing accuracy gains as compared with several other linear Transformers for language modeling. We also thoroughly tested FLTs on other data modalities and tasks, such as: image classification and 3D molecular modeling. For 3D-data FLTs are, to the best of our knowledge, the first Transformers architectures providing RPE-enhanced linear attention.

Yet compilers remain challenging environments for interacting with ML frameworks. Some optimizations require tightly coupled models and compiler internals, raising issues with modularity, performance and ML framework independence. Practical deployment and transparency for the end-user are also important concerns. We propose a library allowing ML model development within a traditional Python framework while enabling efficient, end-to-end integration with an optimizing compiler. We evaluate it on both research and production use cases, for training and inference, over four optimization problems. Authors S.

Yet, outside of specific tasks that require explicit temporal understanding, static image pretraining remains the dominant paradigm for learning visual foundation models. We question this mismatch, and ask whether video pretraining can yield visual representations that bear the hallmarks of human perception: generalisation across tasks, robustness to perturbations, and consistency with human judgements. To that end we propose a novel procedure for curating videos, and develop a contrastive framework which learns from the complex transformations therein. This simple paradigm for distilling knowledge from videos, called VITO, yields general representations that far outperform prior video pretraining methods on image understanding tasks, and image pretraining methods on video understanding tasks. Moreover, VITO representations are significantly more robust to natural and synthetic deformations than image-, video-, and adversarially-trained ones. Finally, VITO's predictions are strongly aligned with human judgements, surpassing models that were specifically trained for that purpose. Together, these results suggest that video pretraining could be a simple way of learning unified, robust, and human-aligned representations of the visual world.

In contrast, we train video-first encoders, plug them into a frozen LM, and demonstrate that utilizing joint space-time attention yields improvements on benchmarks with strong temporal dependencies (e.g., YouCook2, VATEX). However, we expose two limitations to the approach: (1) decreased spatial capabilities, likely due to noisy video-language alignments and (2) higher memory consumption, bottlenecking the number of frames that can be processed. To mitigate the memory bottleneck, we systematically analyze ways to improve memory efficiency for training video-first encoders including input sampling, parameter-efficient image-to-video adaptation, and factorized attention. Surprisingly, just masking large portions of the video (up to 75%) proves to be the most robust way to scale encoders to videos up to 4.3 minutes at 1 fps rate. Our simple approach for training long video-to-text models, which account for less than 1B parameters, is able to outperform the popular paradigm of using a strong LLM as information aggregator over segment-based information on benchmarks with long range temporal dependencies (YouCook2, EgoSchema).

In this paper, we consider partially observed environments (POEs), where an agent's spatial position cannot be deterministically recovered from its observation, which makes planning hard. We introduce a transformer with (multiple) discrete bottleneck(s), TDB, whose latent codes learn a compressed representation of the observations. After training a TDB with an augmented objective on sequences of observations and actions, we extract interpretable cognitive maps of the environment from the active bottleneck(s) indices. These maps are then paired with an external solver to solve planning problems. First, we show that a TDB trained on POEs (a) retains the near-perfect predictive performance of a vanilla transformer or an LSTM while (b) solving shortest paths problems exponentially more efficiently. Second, a TDB extracts interpretable representations from text datasets, while reaching higher in-context accuracy than vanilla sequence models. Finally, in new POEs, a TDB (a) reaches near-perfect in-context accuracy, (b) learns accurate in-context cognitive maps (c) solves in-context planning problems.

In this paper, we propose OmniPred, a framework for training language models as universal end-to-end regressors over (x,y) evaluation data from diverse real world experiments. Using data sourced from Google Vizier, one of the largest blackbox optimization databases in the world, our extensive experiments demonstrate that through only textual representations of mathematical parameters and values, language models are capable of very precise numerical regression, and if given the opportunity to train over multiple tasks, can significantly outperform traditional regression models.

Core to the framework is a self-discover process where LLMs select multiple atomic reasoning modules, and compose them into an explicit and task-unique reasoning structure for LLMs to follow during decoding, in sharp contrast to the implicit reasoning in CoT. SELF-DISCOVER substantially improves GPT-4 and PaLM-2’s performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as BigBench-Hard and Thinking4Doing, by as much as 30%. Furthermore, SELF-DISCOVER outperforms inference-intensive methods such as CoT-Self-Consistency and majority voting by more than 20% across 24 tasks on multiple LLMs, while requiring 10-40x fewer inference compute. Finally, the self-discovered reasoning structures by GPT-4 can also be applied to smaller models of Llama 2 to improving their reasoning capabilities, demonstrating generalization of the discovered reasoning structures.

We propose an algorithm that uses fixed allocations based on the prior information and the structure of the environment. We provide theoretical bounds on its performance across diverse models, including the first prior-dependent upper bounds for linear and hierarchical BAI. Our key contribution is introducing new proof methods that result in tighter bounds for multi-armed BAI compared to existing methods. We extensively compare our approach to other fixed-budget BAI methods, demonstrating its consistent and robust performance in various settings. Our work improves our understanding of Bayesian fixed-budget BAI in structured bandits and highlights the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.

Chain-of-Thought and its alike approaches have demonstrated impressive performance by incorporating the reasoning chain in the form of textual context. However, it is still an open question how to properly involve tabular data in the reasoning chain for the table-based tasks. Inspired by nested queries in SQL development where temporary tables are used to store intermediate results, we propose Chain-of-Table, where we update the table iteratively to represent the complex reasoning chain. In our approach, the tabular context evolves as a sequence of operations generated by a large language model, where the generation of the latter operation is conditioned on the results of the previous operation. In this way, the constantly evolving table forms a chain, showing the reasoning process of the given problem. The result table carries rich information of the intermediate results so that large language models can skip the complex reasoning over the latent clues, directly aggregate relevant information from the result table, and come to the final prediction easily. Extensive experiments with two large language models show that Chain-of-Table surpasses competitive baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in three well-known benchmark datasets (WikiTableQuestions, and FeTaQA, and TabFact).

To ensure the quality of the model, transfer learning approaches have been developed to automatically design GP priors by learning from data on ""training"" functions. These training functions are typically required to have the same domain as the ""test"" function (black-box function to be optimized). In this paper, we introduce MPHD, a model pre-training method on heterogeneous domains, which uses a neural net mapping from domain descriptions to specifications of a hierarchical GP. MPHD can be seamlessly integrated with BO to transfer knowledge across heterogeneous search spaces. Our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate the validity of MPHD and its superior performance on challenging black-box function optimization tasks.

However, we observe that LLMs are surprisingly brittle to different premise orders, despite that such ordering does not alter the underlying task. In particular, we observe that LLMs achieve the best performance when the premise order aligns with the context required in intermediate reasoning steps. For example, in deductive reasoning tasks,  presenting the premises in the same order as the ground truth proof in the prompt (as opposed to random ordering) drastically increases the model's accuracy. We first examine the effect of premise ordering on deductive reasoning on a variety of LLMs, and our evaluation shows that even if the model performance is decent on the optimal order, permuting the premise order can cause a performance drop of over 30%. In addition, we introduce the R-GSM benchmark based on GSM8K to examine the ordering effect for math problem solving, and we again observe a significant accuracy decrease compared to the original GSM8K problems.

Compared to ordinary neural networks, E(3)-equivariant models promise benefits whenever input and/or output data are quantities associated with three-dimensional objects. This is because the numeric values of such quantities (e.g. positions) typically depend on the chosen coordinate system. Under transformations of the reference frame, the values change predictably, but the underlying rules can be difficult to learn for ordinary machine learning models. With built-in E(3)-equivariance, neural networks are guaranteed to satisfy the relevant transformation rules exactly, resulting in superior data efficiency and accuracy.

As models keep scaling, it is crucial to leverage distributed computation resources that might be even geographically distant from each other. Due to the latency and heterogeneity of these computation devices, it is natural to consider Local Stochastic Gradient Descent (localSGD) (e.g., each device performs more than one update per communication) and asynchronous training (the server updates the global parameter vector as soon as a worker has completed its local updates). This work presents an initial study on asynchronous localSGD for language modeling. We conduct a comprehensive investigation by examining how worker heterogeneity, model size, number of workers, and optimizer could impact the learning performance. We identified that a key hurdle of applying asynchronous localSGD in language modeling is the application of momentum acceleration on the server side when worker gradients are staled. In this setting, asynchronous localSGD takes more iterations to converge than its synchronous counterpart despite updating the global parameters more frequently. To mitigate this optimization challenge, we propose a novel method that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts the workers' local training steps based on their computation speed. This approach, evaluated with models up to 150M parameters on the C4 dataset, not only matches the performance of synchronous localSGD in terms of perplexity per update step but also surpasses it significantly in terms of wall clock time. For the convenience of future research and quick prototyping of new ideas, we also make available a toy framework that replicates the observed  optimization challenges on a mixture of mixtures of Gaussians. We hope this work can bring new insights and tools to facilitate future discovery of more efficient language model optimizers.

Broad exposure to different tasks leads to versatile representations enabling general problem solving. But, what are the limits of meta-learning? In this work, we explore the potential of amortizing the most powerful universal predictor, namely Solomonoff Induction (SI), into neural networks via leveraging meta-learning to its limits. We use Universal Turing Machines (UTMs) to generate training data used to expose networks to a broad range of patterns. We provide theoretical analysis of the UTM data generation processes and meta-training protocols. We conduct comprehensive experiments with neural architectures (e.g. LSTMs, Transformers) and algorithmic data generators of varying complexity and universality. Our results suggest that UTM data is a valuable resource for meta-learning, and that it can be used to train neural networks capable of learning universal prediction strategies.

This opens the door to richer interaction with the world, for example robotic control. However, VLMs produce only textual outputs, while robotic control and other spatial tasks require outputting continuous coordinates, actions, or trajectories. How can we enable VLMs to handle such settings without fine-tuning on task-specific data? In this paper, we propose a novel visual prompting approach for VLMs that we call Prompting with Iterative Visual Optimization (PIVOT), which casts tasks as iterative visual question answering. In each iteration, the image is annotated with a visual representation of proposals that the VLM can refer to (e.g., candidate robot actions, localizations, or trajectories). The VLM then selects the best ones for the task. These proposals are iteratively refined, allowing the VLM to eventually zero in on the best available answer. We investigate PIVOT on real-world robotic navigation, real-world manipulation from images, instruction following in simulation, and additional spatial inference tasks such as localization. We find, perhaps surprisingly, that our approach enables zero-shot control of robotic systems without any robot training data, navigation in a variety of environments, and other capabilities. Although current performance is far from perfect, our work highlights potentials and limitations of this new regime and shows a promising approach for Internet-Scale VLMs in robotic and spatial reasoning domains.

Language is a key medium of interaction for humans, though it has historically proven difficult to model dialogue and its strategic motivations mathematically. A suitable model of the players, strategies, and payoffs associated with linguistic interactions (i.e., a binding to the conventional symbolic logic of game theory) would enable existing game-theoretic algorithms to provide strategic solutions in the space of language. In other words, a binding could provide a route to computing stable, rational conversational strategies in dialogue. Large language models (LLMs) have arguably reached a point where their generative capabilities can enable realistic, human-like simulations of natural dialogue. By prompting them in various ways, we can steer their responses towards different output utterances. Leveraging the expressivity of natural language, LLMs can also help us quickly generate new dialogue scenarios, which are grounded in real world applications. In this work, we present one possible binding from dialogue to game theory as well as generalizations of existing equilibrium finding algorithms to this setting. In addition, by exploiting LLMs generation capabilities along with our proposed binding, we can synthesize a large repository of formally-defined games in which one can study and test game-theoretic solution concepts. We also demonstrate how one can combine LLM-driven game generation, game-theoretic solvers, and imitation learning to construct a process for improving the strategic capabilities of LLMs. Authors Ian Gemp, Yoram Bachrach, Marc Lanctot, Roma Patel, Vibhavari Dasagi, Luke Marris, Georgios Piliouras, Siqi Liu, Karl Tuyls Venue arXiv     Footer links    Follow us                                              About         About Google DeepMind   Responsibility & Safety   Research   Technologies   Blog   Careers        Learn more         Gemini   Veo   Imagen   SynthID                           Sign up for updates on our latest innovations                        Email address           Please enter a valid email (e.g., ""name@example.com"")     I accept Google's Terms and Conditions and acknowledge that my information will be used in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.

Analogous to how the successor representation (SR) describes the expected consequences of behaving according to a given policy, our distributional successor measure (SM) describes the distributional consequences of this behaviour. We formulate the distributional SM as a distribution over distributions and provide theory connecting it with distributional and model-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose an algorithm that learns the distributional SM from data by minimizing a two-level maximum mean discrepancy. Key to our method are a number of algorithmic techniques that are independently valuable for learning generative models of state. As an illustration of the usefulness of the distributional SM, we show that it enables zero-shot risk-sensitive policy evaluation in a way that was not previously possible.

(2023). Our analysis provides new theoretical results on categorical approaches to distributional RL, and also introduces a new distributional Bellman equation, the stochastic categorical CDF Bellman equation, which we expect to be of independent interest. We also provide an experimental study comparing several model-based distributional RL algorithms, with several takeaways for practitioners.

We propose NeuPL-JPSRO, which extends this idea to n-player general-sum games and leverages the convergence guarantees of Joint Policy-Space Response Oracle (JPSRO). We show empirically that NeuPL-JPSRO converges to a Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) in several OpenSpiel games, as verified by analytical game solvers. We then deploy NeuPL-JPSRO to complex domains where JPSRO with independent RL becomes computationally impractical. We demonstrate how our approach enables adaptive coordination with co-players and transfer learning of skills in larger games. Our work shows that equilibrium convergent population learning can be implemented at scale and in generality, paving the way towards solving real-world games between heterogeneous players with mixed motives.

We establish that language is: (1) self-similar, exhibiting complexities at all levels of granularity, with no particular characteristic granularity level or context length, and (2) long-range dependent (LRD), with tokens at any instant typically correlated with all subsequent tokens. Based on these findings, we argue that short-term patterns in language, such as in paragraphs, mirror the patterns seen in larger scopes, like entire documents. This may shed some light on how next-token prediction can lead to a comprehension of the structure of text at multiple levels of granularity, from words and clauses to broader contexts and intents. In addition, we demonstrate a connection between fractal parameters, such as the Hurst exponent, and scaling laws when varying the context length at inference time. We hope that these findings offer a fresh perspective on the nature of language and the mechanisms underlying the success of LLMs. Authors Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin, Vinh Q.

While various attempts have been made to extend this context, this has often come at the cost of both conceptual and computational complexity. We propose to instead re-purpose existing pre-trained video transformers by simply fine-tuning them to attend to memories derived non-parametrically from past activations. By leveraging redundancy reduction, our memory-consolidated vision transformer (MC-ViT) effortlessly extends its context far into the past and exhibits excellent scaling behavior when learning from longer videos. In doing so, MC-ViT sets a new state-of-the-art in long-context video understanding on EgoSchema, Perception Test, and Diving48, outperforming methods that benefit from orders of magnitude more parameters.

However, it is not known if agents must learn causal models in order to generalise under distributional shifts, or if other inductive biases are sufficient. We answer this question, showing that any agent capable of satisfying a regret bound under a large set of distributional shifts must have learned an approximate causal model of the data generating process, which converges to the true causal model for optimal agents. We discuss the implications of this result for several research areas including transfer learning and causal inference.

In our experiments, an agent sequentially generates queries while fitting a reward model to the feedback received.  Our best-performing agent generates queries using double Thompson sampling, with uncertainty represented by an epistemic neural network.  Our results demonstrate that efficient exploration enables high levels of performance with far fewer queries.  Further, both uncertainty estimation and the choice of exploration scheme play critical roles.

Pseudo-games are a generalization of games in which players' actions affect not only the payoffs of other players but also their feasible action spaces. Although the computation of GNE and CE is intractable in the worst-case, i.e., PPAD-hard, in practice, many applications only require solutions with high accuracy in expectation over a distribution of problem instances. We introduce Generative Adversarial Equilibrium Solvers (GAES): a family of generative adversarial neural networks that can learn GNE and CE from only a sample of problem instances. We provide computational and sample complexity bounds for Lipschitz-smooth function approximators in a large class of concave pseudo-games, and apply the framework to finding Nash equilibria in normal-form games, CE in Arrow-Debreu competitive economies, and GNE in an environmental economic model of the Kyoto mechanism.

Computational neuroscientists typically face a difficult choice between symbolic model-driven approaches that are interpretable, but underperform at predicting animal behavior, versus data-driven approaches that train overparameterized models to make accurate behavioral predictions with often hard-to-interpret, blackbox models. In this work, we explore the use of an automated LLM-based program discovery tool (FunSearch, \cite{romeraparedes2024mathematical}) to discover novel symbolic programs that accurately describe animal behavior without sacrificing interpretability. We dub this CogFunSearch, and verify its efficacy on behavioral data from rodent reward-guided choice behaviors \cite{miller2021predictive}. We find that CogFunSearch is able to reliably discover programs that outperform the state-of-the-art cognitive model for predicting rat choices in a 2-armed drifting bandit task. This is the case both when CogFunSearch is used to improve on inputted programs, as well as when it is used to discover programs from scratch. Moreover, we find that CogFunSearch is sensitive to semantic information in the prompt: prompts that provide details of the dataset and suggest an RL modeling framework lead to quantitatively better programs than uninformative prompts. Both the classic models and the discovered programs are significantly outperformed by a simple, yet unconstrained, neural network, implying that there remains substantial room for improvement in the predictive performance of the discovered functions. Broadly, these results provide early insights into the use of LLM-based program discovery tools to find models of cognition.

We anticipate that within our lifetimes it may become common practice for people to create a custom AI agent to interact with loved ones and/or the broader world after death; we call such embodiments generative ghosts since such agents will be capable of generating novel content rather than merely parroting content produced by their creator while living. In this position paper, we first discuss the design space of potential implementations of generative ghosts. We then discuss the practical and ethical implications of generative ghosts, including potential positive and negative impacts on individuals and society. Based on these considerations, we lay out a research agenda for the AI and HCI research communities to empower people to create and interact with AI afterlives in a safe and beneficial manner.

Which one do researchers mean when they talk about ``planning as inference''? There is no consistency in the literature, different types are used, and their ability to do planning is further entangled with specific approximations or additional constraints. In this work we use the variational framework to show that all commonly used types of inference correspond to different weighings of the entropy terms in the variational problem, and that planning corresponds exactly to a different set of weights. This means that all the tricks of variational inference are readily applicable to planning. We develop an analogue of loopy belief propagation that allows us to perform approximate planning in factored-state Markov decisions processes without incurring intractability due to the exponentially large state space.  The variational perspective shows that the previous types of inference for planning are only adequate in environments with low stochasticity, and allows us to characterize each type by its own merits, disentangling the type of inference from the additional approximations that its practical use requires. We validate these results empirically on synthetic MDPs and tasks posed on the International Planning Competition.

We propose a training method which avoids agents learning undesired multi-step plans that receive high reward even if humans are not able to detect that the behaviour is undesired. The method, Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval (MONA), works by combining short-sighted optimization with far-sighted reward. We demonstrate that MONA can prevent multi-step reward hacking that ordinary RL causes, even without being able to detect the reward hacking and without any extra information that the ordinary RL does not get access to. We study MONA empirically in three settings which model different misalignment failure modes including 2-step environments with LLMs representing delegated oversight and encoded reasoning and longer-horizon gridworld environments representing sensor tampering.

However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks.

In contrast to autoregressive (AR) tasks, such as language processing, our focus is on scenarios with multiple agents whose interactions are shaped by physical constraints and internal motivations. To this end, we propose Poly-Autoregressive (PAR) modeling, which forecasts an ego agent's future behavior by reasoning about the ego agent's state history and the past and current states of other interacting agents. At its core, PAR represents the behavior of all agents as a sequence of tokens, each representing an agent's state at a specific timestep. With minimal data pre-processing changes, we show that PAR can be applied to three different problems: human action forecasting in social situations, trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles, and object pose forecasting during hand-object interaction. Using a small proof-of-concept transformer backbone, PAR outperforms AR across these three scenarios.

However, both the LLM and the vision encoder come with their own set of biases, cue preferences, and shortcuts, which have been rigorously studied in uni-modal models. A timely question is how such (potentially misaligned) biases and cue preferences behave under multi-modal fusion in VLMs. As a first step towards a better understanding, we investigate a particularly well-studied vision-only bias - the texture vs. shape bias and the dominance of local over global information. As expected, we find that VLMs inherit this bias to some extent from their vision encoders. Surprisingly, the multi-modality alone proves to have important effects on the model behavior, i.e., the joint training and the language querying change the way visual cues are processed. While this direct impact of language-informed training on a model’s visual perception is intriguing, it raises further questions on our ability to actively steer a model’s output so that its prediction is based on particular visual cues of the user’s choice. Interestingly, VLMs have an inherent tendency to recognize objects based on shape information, which is different from what a plain vision encoder would do. Further active steering towards shape-based classifications through language prompts is however limited. In contrast, active VLM steering towards texture-based decisions through simple natural language prompts is often more successful.

In particular, program mutation can alter the test’s control and data flow inside the kernel by inserting new system calls, changing the values of call arguments, or performing other program mutations. However, due to the complexity of the kernel code and its user-space interface, finding the effective mutation that can lead to the desired outcome such as increasing the coverage and reaching a target code location is extremely difficult, even with the widespread use of manually-crafted heuristics. This work proposes Snowplow, a kernel fuzzer that uses a learned white-box test mutator to enhance test mutation. The core of Snowplow is an efficient machine learning model that can learn to predict promising mutations given the test program to mutate, its kernel code coverage, and the desired coverage. Snowplow is demonstrated on argument mutations of the kernel tests, and evaluated on recent Linux kernel releases. When fuzzing the kernels for 24 hours, Snowplow shows a significant speedup of discovering new coverage (4.8×∼5.2×) and achieves higher overall coverage (7.0%∼8.6%). In a 7-day fuzzing campaign, Snowplow discovers 86 previously-unknown crashes. Furthermore, the learned mutator is shown to accelerate directed kernel fuzzing by reaching 19 target code locations 8.5× faster and two additional locations that are missed by the state-of-the-art directed kernel fuzzer.

A user could describe a desired sensing task in natural language (e.g., ""alert if my toddler is getting into mischief""), with the MLLM analyzing the camera feed and responding within seconds. In a formative study, we found that users saw substantial value in defining their own sensors, yet struggled to articulate their unique personal requirements and debug the sensors through prompting alone. To address these challenges, we developed Gensors, a system that empowers users to define customized sensors supported by the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Gensors 1) assists users in eliciting requirements through both automatically-generated and manually created sensor criteria, 2) facilitates debugging by allowing users to isolate and test individual criteria in parallel, 3) suggests additional criteria based on user-provided images, and 4) proposes test cases to help users ""stress test"" sensors on potentially unforeseen scenarios. In a user study, participants reported significantly greater sense of control, understanding, and ease of communication when defining sensors using Gensors. Beyond addressing model limitations, Gensors supported users in debugging, eliciting requirements, and expressing unique personal requirements to the sensor through criteria-based reasoning; it also helped uncover users' ""blind spots"" by exposing overlooked criteria and revealing unanticipated failure modes. Finally, we discuss how unique characteristics of MLLMs--such as hallucinations and inconsistent responses--can impact the sensor-creation process. These findings contribute to the design of future intelligent sensing systems that are intuitive and customizable by everyday users.

Unlike the Boltzmann and Gibbs-Shannon entropies, it requires no prior commitment to macrovariables or probabilistic ensembles, rendering it applicable to settings arbitrarily far from equilibrium. For measure-preserving dynamical systems equipped with a Markovian coarse-graining, we prove a number of fluctuation inequalities. These include algorithmic versions of Jarzynski's equality, Landauer's principle, and the second law of thermodynamics. In general, the algorithmic entropy determines a system's actual capacity to do work from an individual state, whereas the Gibbs-Shannon entropy only gives the mean capacity to do work from a state ensemble that is known a priori.

For this reason, self-supervised image-only pretraining is still the go-to method for many dense vision applications (e.g. depth estimation, semantic segmentation), despite the lack of explicit supervisory signals. In this paper, we close this gap between image-text and self-supervised learning, by proposing a novel general-purpose image-text model, which can be effectively used off the shelf for dense and global vision tasks. Our method, which we refer to as Text-Image Pretraining with Spatial awareness (TIPS), leverages two simple and effective insights. First, on textual supervision: we reveal that replacing noisy web image captions by synthetically generated textual descriptions boosts dense understanding performance significantly, due to a much richer signal for learning spatially aware representations. We propose an adapted training method that combines noisy and synthetic captions, resulting in improvements across both dense and global understanding tasks. Second, on the learning technique: we propose to combine contrastive image-text learning with self-supervised masked image modeling, to encourage spatial coherence, unlocking substantial enhancements for downstream applications. Building on these two ideas, we scale our model using the transformer architecture, trained on a curated set of public images. Our experiments are conducted on 8 tasks involving 16 datasets in total, demonstrating strong off-the-shelf performance on both dense and global understanding, for several image-only and image-text tasks.

We find that model performance tends to saturate at this scale on many common Western-centric classification and retrieval benchmarks, such as COCO Captions. Nevertheless, tasks of cultural diversity achieve more substantial gains from the 100-billion scale web data, thanks to its coverage of long-tail concepts. Furthermore, we analyze the model's multilinguality and show gains in low-resource languages as well. In addition, we observe that reducing the size of the pretraining dataset via quality filters like using CLIP, typically used to enhance performance, may inadvertently reduce the cultural diversity represented even in large-scale datasets. Our results highlight that while traditional benchmarks may not benefit significantly from scaling noisy, raw web data to 100 billion examples, this data scale is vital for building truly inclusive multimodal systems.

This may be mitigated by accounting for epistemic uncertainty, which is however challenging to estimate efficiently for large neural networks. To this extent we investigate the Delta Variance family, a family of algorithms for epistemic uncertainty quantification, that is computationally efficient and convenient to implement. It can be applied to neural networks and more general functions composed of neural networks. As an example we consider a weather simulator with a neural-network-based step function inside - here Delta Variances empirically obtain competitive results at the cost of a single gradient computation. The approach is convenient as it requires no changes to the neural network architecture or training procedure. We discuss multiple ways to derive Delta Variances theoretically noting that special cases recover popular techniques and present a unified perspective on multiple related methods. Finally we observe that this general perspective gives rise to a natural extension and empirically show its benefit.

Despite the promise, their performance on real-world applications that often involve combinations of tasks is still underexplored. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark, called CompWoB -- 50 new compositional web automation tasks reflecting more realistic assumptions. We show that while existing prompted LMAs (gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4) achieve 94.0% average success rate on base tasks, their performance degrades to 24.9% success rate on compositional tasks. On the other hand, transferred LMAs (finetuned only on base tasks) show less generalization gap, dropping from 85.4% to 54.8%. By balancing data distribution across tasks, we train a new model, HTML-T5++, that surpasses human-level performance (95.2%) on MiniWoB, and achieves the best zero-shot performance on CompWoB (61.5%). While these highlight the promise of small-scale finetuned and transferred models for task compositionality, their performance further degrades under different instruction compositions changing combinational order. In contrast to the recent remarkable success of LMA, our benchmark and detailed analysis emphasize the necessity of building LMAs that are robust and generalizable to task compositionality for real-world deployment.

This paper investigates the synergy between these disciplines in two directions: AIT for Kernel Methods and Kernel Methods for AIT. In the former, we explore how AIT concepts inspire the design of kernels that integrate principles like relative Kolmogorov complexity and normalized compression distance (NCD). We also leverage the Loss Rank Principle (LoRP) to learn kernels in the context of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), extending the applicability of AIT-inspired techniques to flexible, nonparametric models. In the latter, we show how kernel methods can be used to approximate measures such as NCD and Algorithmic Mutual Information (AMI), providing new tools for compression-based analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) approximates AMI, offering a robust theoretical foundation for clustering and other dependence-measurement tasks.  Building on our previous work introducing Sparse Kernel Flows from an AIT perspective, we extend these ideas to unsupervised learning, enhancing the theoretical robustness and interpretability of ML algorithms. Our results demonstrate that kernel methods are not only versatile tools for ML but also crucial for bridging AIT and ML, enabling more principled approaches to unsupervised learning tasks. Keywords.

Our goal will be to construct a coding distribution that is both universal and can be used as a control policy. Allowing for action generation needs careful treatment, as naive approaches which do not distinguish between actions and observations run into the self-delusion problem in universal settings. We showcase our perspective in the context of the challenging non-stationary stochastic bernoulli bandit problem. Our main contribution is an efficient and high performing algorithm for the non-stationary Stochastic bernoulli bandit problem that generalises the Partition Tree Weighting universal source coding technique for passive prediction to the control setting.

Capitalizing on Gemini's inherent multilingual and code understanding capabilities, Gemini Embedding produces highly generalizable embeddings for text spanning numerous languages and textual modalities. The representations generated by Gemini Embedding can be precomputed and applied to a variety of downstream tasks including classification, similarity, clustering, ranking, and retrieval. Evaluated on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB), which includes over one hundred tasks across 250+ languages, Gemini Embedding substantially outperforms prior state-of-the-art models, demonstrating considerable improvements in embedding quality. Achieving state-of-the-art performance across MMTEB's multilingual, English, and code benchmarks, our unified model demonstrates strong capabilities across a broad selection of tasks and surpasses specialized domain-specific models.

A ""visual analogy"" is an abstract rule inferred from one image and applied to another. While benchmarks exist for testing visual reasoning in LMMs, they require advanced skills and omit basic visual analogies that even young children can make. Inspired by developmental psychology, we propose a new benchmark of 4,300 visual transformations of everyday objects to test LMMs on visual analogical reasoning and compare them to children (ages three to five) and to adults. We structure the evaluation into three stages: identifying what changed (e.g., color, number, etc.), how it changed (e.g., added one object), and applying the rule to new scenarios. Our findings show that while GPT-o1, GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MANTIS identify the ""what"" effectively, they struggle with quantifying the ""how"" and extrapolating this rule to new objects. In contrast, children and adults exhibit much stronger analogical reasoning at all three stages. Additionally, the strongest tested model, GPT-o1, performs better in tasks involving simple surface-level visual attributes like color and size, correlating with quicker human adult response times. Conversely, more complex tasks such as number, rotation, and reflection, which necessitate extensive cognitive processing and understanding of extrinsic spatial properties in the physical world, present more significant challenges. Altogether, these findings highlight the limitations of training models on data that primarily consists of 2D images and text.

However, human preferences can vary across individuals, and therefore should be represented distributionally. In this work, we introduce the distributional soft preference labels and improve Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a weighted geometric average of the LLM output likelihood in the loss function. This approach adjusts the scale of learning loss based on the soft labels such that the loss would approach zero when the responses are closer to equally preferred. This simple modification can be easily applied to any DPO-based methods and mitigate over-optimization and objective mismatch, which prior works suffer from. Our experiments simulate the soft preference labels with AI feedback from LLMs and demonstrate that geometric averaging consistently improves performance on standard benchmarks for alignment research. In particular, we observe more preferable responses than binary labels and significant improvements where modestly-confident labels are in the majority.

On the popular D4RL benchmark, we show performance that is significantly better than existing model-based offline planning methods using MPC and competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods. We additionally illustrate D-MPC's ability to optimize novel reward functions at run time and adapt to novel dynamics, and highlight its advantages compared to existing diffusion-based planning baselines.

This work takes a step towards that goal and presents the first learned robot agent that reaches amateur human-level performance in competitive table tennis. Table tennis is a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. In this paper, we contribute (1) a hierarchical and modular policy architecture consisting of (i) low level controllers with their detailed skill descriptors which model the agent's capabilities and help to bridge the sim-to-real gap and (ii) a high level controller that chooses the low level skills, (2) techniques for enabling zero-shot sim-to-real including an iterative approach to defining the task distribution that is grounded in the real-world and defines an automatic curriculum, and (3) real time adaptation to unseen opponents. Policy performance was assessed through 29 robot vs. human matches of which the robot won 45% (13/29). All humans were unseen players and their skill level varied from beginner to tournament level. Whilst the robot lost all matches vs. the most advanced players it won 100% matches vs. beginners and 55% matches vs. intermediate players, demonstrating solidly amateur human-level performance.

Generative machine-learning (ML) models have emerged as a promising tool in this space, building on the success of this approach in applications such as image, text and audio generation. Often, however, generative tasks in scientific domains have unique structures and features — such as complex symmetries and the requirement of exactness guarantees — that present both challenges and opportunities for ML. This Perspective outlines the advances in ML-based sampling motivated by lattice quantum field theory, in particular for the theory of quantum chromodynamics. Enabling calculations of the structure and interactions of matter from our most fundamental understanding of particle physics, lattice quantum chromodynamics is one of the main consumers of open-science supercomputing worldwide. The design of ML algorithms for this application faces profound challenges, including the necessity of scaling custom ML architectures to the largest supercomputers, but also promises immense benefits, and is spurring a wave of development in ML-based sampling more broadly. In lattice field theory, if this approach can realize its early promise it will be a transformative step towards first-principles physics calculations in particle, nuclear and condensed matter physics that are intractable with traditional approaches.

The first one only uses function queries, while the second one also uses gradient queries. Other algorithms exist under much stronger assumptions, such as Newton's method for twice-differentiable, strongly convex functions with Lipschitz gradients. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no principled exact line search algorithm that for general convex functions — including piecewise-linear and max-compositions of convex functions — that takes advantage of convexity. We propose two such algorithms: $\Delta$-Bisection is a variant of bisection search that uses (sub)gradient information and convexity to speed up convergence, while $\Delta$-Secant is a variant of golden-section search and uses only function queries. Both algorithms are based on a refined definition of the optimality region $\Delta$ containing the minimum point, for general convex functions. While bisection search reduces the $x$ interval by a factor 2 at every iteration, $\Delta$-Bisection reduces the (sometimes much) smaller $x^*$-gap $\Delta^x$ (the $x$ coordinates of $\Delta$) by at least a factor 2 at every iteration. Similarly, $\Delta$-Secant also reduces the $x^*$-gap by at least a factor 2 every second function query. Moreover, and possibly more importantly, the $y^*$-gap $\Delta^y$ (the $y$ coordinates of $\Delta$) also provides a refined stopping criterion, which can also be used with other algorithms. Experiments on a few convex functions confirm that our algorithms are always faster than their quasiconvex counterparts, often by more than a factor 2. We further design a quasi-exact line search algorithm based on $\Delta$-Secant. It can be used with gradient descent as a replacement for backtracking line search, for which some parameters can be finicky to tune — and we provide examples to this effect, on strongly-convex and smooth functions. We provide convergence guarantees, and confirm the efficiency of quasi-exact line search on a few single- and multivariate convex functions.

In this paper we show that search-based planning can significantly improve LLMs’ playing strength across several board games (Chess, Fischer Random Chess, Connect Four, and Hex). We introduce, compare and contrast two major approaches: In external search, the model guides Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts and evaluations without calls to an external engine, and in internal search,the model directly generates in-context a linearized tree of potential futures and a resulting final choice. Both build on a model pre-trained on relevant domain knowledge, capturing the transition and value functions across these games. We find that our pre-training method minimizes hallucinations, as our model is highly accurate regarding state prediction and legal moves. Additionally, both internal and external search indeed improve win-rates against state-of-the-art bots, even reaching Grandmaster-level performance in chess while operating on a similar move count search budget per decision as human Grandmasters. The way we combine search with domain knowledge is not specific to board games, suggesting direct extensions into more general language model inference and training techniques.

In this paper, we provide one of the first comprehensive investigations into embedding-based regression and demonstrate that LLM embeddings as features can be better for high-dimensional regression tasks than using traditional feature engineering. This regression performance can be explained in part due to LLM embeddings over numeric data inherently preserving Lipschitz continuity over the feature space. Furthermore, we quantify the contribution of different model effects, most notably model size and language understanding, which we find surprisingly do not always improve regression performance.

However, they have limited usefulness for long form creative writing because they lack long-range semantic coherence. We address this limitation by applying language models hierarchically ,in a system we call Dramatron. By building structural context via prompt chaining, Dramatron can generate coherent scripts and screenplays complete with a title, characters, story beats, location descriptions, and dialogue. We illustrate Dramatron’s usefulness as an interactive co-creative system with a user-study of 15 theatre and film industry professionals, who co-wrote theatre scripts and screenplays with Dramatron and engaged in open-ended interviews. We report reflections from our interviewees, and from independent reviewers who watched recent stagings of these works, to illustrate how both Dramatron and hierarchical text generation are useful for human-machine co-creativity. Finally, we discuss the suitability of Dramatron for co-creativity, ethical considerations–including plagiarism and bias–and participation models for the design and deployment of such tools.

Contrary to a common expectation that BO is suited to optimizing black-box functions, it actually requires domain knowledge about those functions to deploy BO successfully. Such domain knowledge often manifests in Gaussian process (GP) priors that specify initial beliefs on functions. However, even with expert knowledge, it is non-trivial to quantitatively define a prior. This is especially true for hyperparameter tuning problems on complex machine learning models, where landscapes of tuning objectives are often difficult to comprehend. We seek an alternative practice for setting these functional priors. In particular, we consider the scenario where we have data from similar functions that allow us to pre-train a tighter distribution a priori. We detail what pre-training entails for GPs using a KL divergence based loss function, and propose a new pre-training based BO framework named HyperBO. Theoretically, we show bounded posterior predictions and near-zero regrets for HyperBO without assuming the ""ground truth"" GP prior is known. To verify our approach in realistic setups, we collect a large multi-task hyperparameter tuning dataset by training tens of thousands of configurations of near-state-of-the-art deep learning models on popular image and text datasets, as well as a protein sequence dataset. Our results show that on average, HyperBO is able to locate good hyperparameters at least 3 times more efficiently than the best competing methods on both our new tuning dataset and existing multi-task BO benchmarks.

An even more ambitious goal is to build models that never stop adapting, and that become increasingly more efficient through time by suitably transferring the accrued knowledge. Beyond the study of the actual learning algorithm and model architecture, there are several hurdles towards our quest to build such models, such as the choice of learning protocol, metric of success and data needed to validate research hypotheses. In this work, we introduce the Never-Ending VIsual-classification Stream (NEVIS'22), a benchmark consisting of a stream of over $100$ visual classification tasks, sorted chronologically and extracted from papers sampled uniformly from computer vision proceedings spanning the last three decades. The resulting stream reflects what the research community thought was meaningful at any point in time, and it serves as an ideal test bed to assess how well models can adapt to new tasks, and do so better and more efficiently as time goes by. Despite being limited to classification, the resulting stream has a rich diversity of tasks from OCR, to texture analysis, scene recognition, and so forth. The diversity is also reflected in the wide range of dataset sizes, spanning over four orders of magnitude. Overall, NEVIS'22 poses an unprecedented challenge for current sequential learning approaches due to the scale and diversity of tasks, yet with a low entry barrier as it is limited to a single modality and well understood supervised learning problems. Moreover, we provide a reference implementation including strong baselines and an evaluation protocol to compare methods in terms of their trade-off between accuracy and compute. We hope that NEVIS'22 can be useful to researchers working on continual learning, meta-learning, AutoML and more generally sequential learning, and help these communities join forces towards more robust models that efficiently adapt to a never ending stream of data.

It is my professional opinion that prompting is a poor user interface for generative AI systems, and should be phased out as quickly as possible. My concerns about prompting are twofold. First, prompt-based interfaces are confusing and non-optimal for end-users (and ought not to be conflated with true natural language interactions). Second, prompt-based interfaces are also risky for AI experts – we risk building a body of apps and research atop a shaky foundation of prompt engineering. I will discuss each of these issues in turn, below.

Collective deliberation can be slow, difficult to scale, and unequally attentive to different voices. In this study, we trained an artificial intelligence (AI) to mediate human deliberation. Using participants’ personal opinions and critiques, the AI mediator iteratively generates and refines statements that express common ground among the group on social or political issues. Participants (N = 5734) preferred AI-generated statements to those written by human mediators, rating them as more informative, clear, and unbiased. Discussants often updated their views after the deliberation, converging on a shared perspective. Text embeddings revealed that successful group statements incorporated dissenting voices while respecting the majority position. These findings were replicated in a virtual citizens’ assembly involving a demographically representative sample of the UK population.

This evaluation is derived via a novel, unifying framework for evaluations over arbitrarily long contexts which measure the model's ability to do more than retrieve a single piece of information from its context. The central idea of the Latent Structure Queries framework (LSQ) is to construct tasks which require a model to ``chisel away'' the irrelevant information in the context, revealing a latent structure in the context. To verify a model's understanding of this latent structure, we query the model for details of the structure. Using LSQ, we produce three diagnostic long-context evaluations across code and natural-language domains intended to provide a stronger signal of long-context language model capabilities. We perform evaluations on several state-of-the-art models and demonstrate both that a) the proposed evaluations are high-signal and b) that there is significant room for improvement in synthesizing long-context information.

We introduce a toy model in which to investigate emergent time asymmetries: the causal multibaker maps. These are reversible discrete-time dynamical systems with configurable causal interactions. Imposing a suitable initial condition or “Past Hypothesis”, and then coarse-graining, yields a Pearlean locally causal structure. While it is more common to speculate that the other arrows of time arise from the thermodynamic arrow, our model instead takes the causal arrow as fundamental. From it, we obtain the thermodynamic and epistemic arrows of time. The epistemic arrow concerns records, which we define to be systems that encode the state of another system at another time, regardless of the latter system’s dynamics. Such records exist of the past, but not of the future. We close with informal discussions of the evolutionary and agential arrows of time, and their relevance to decision theory.

We propose Embed-then-Regress, a paradigm for applying in-context regression over string inputs, through the use of string embedding capabilities of pretrained language models. By expressing all inputs as strings, we are able to perform general-purpose regression for Bayesian Optimization over various domains including synthetic, combinatorial, and hyperparameter optimization, obtaining comparable results to state-of-the-art Gaussian Process-based algorithms.

It comes with a formal guarantee on the number of search steps before finding a solution node, that depends on the quality of the policy. In this paper we consider augmenting the information available to the LTS algorithm with a rerooter, which imperfectly predicts at any given node $n$ whether to focus the search onto the descendants of $n$, which corresponds to rerooting the search at $n$. The rerooter thus implicitly decomposes the search space into subtasks, each subtask $i$ corresponding to finding a node $n^{i+1}$ when starting the search at the node $n^i$. The node $n^{i+1}$ can be seen as the goal of subtask $i$. This new algorithm, √LTS (pronounced root-LTS), is a simple best-first search with a special cost function that allows for √LTS rerooting to arise naturally from how the cost function prioritizes the nodes. We prove that the number of search steps that √LTS takes is competitive with the best decomposition into subtasks, at the price of a factor that relates to the uncertainty of the rerooter. The speed-up compared to LTS without a rerooter can be exponential, and even a single rerooting point can --- in the best case --- reduce the number of search steps to its square root. Like the policy, the rerooter can be learnt from data and we expect √LTS to be applicable to a wide range of domains. Authors Laurent Orseau, Levi H. S.

Second, it was shown that the sink equilibria of a game adequately capture the limit behavior of natural game dynamics. These two results have created a need and opportunity to articulate a principled computational theory of the meaning of the game that is based on game dynamics. Given any game in normal form, and any prior distribution of play, we study the problem of computing the asymptotic behavior of a class of natural dynamics called the noisy replicator dynamics as a limit distribution over the sink equilibria of the game. When the prior distribution has pure strategy support, we prove this distribution can be computed efficiently, in near-linear time to the size of the best-response graph. When the distribution can be sampled --- for example, if it is the uniform distribution over all mixed strategy profiles --- we show through experiments that the limit distribution of reasonably large games can be estimated quite accurately through sampling and simulation.

While Vision Transformer (ViT) based models scale effectively to large data regimes, they fail to capitalize on this inherent redundancy, leading to higher computational costs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) networks demonstrate scalability while maintaining same inference-time costs, but they come with a larger parameter footprint. We present Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE), which utilizes a nested structure for experts, wherein individual experts fall on an increasing compute-accuracy curve. Given a compute budget, MoNE learns to dynamically choose tokens in a priority order, and thus redundant tokens are processed through cheaper nested experts. Using this framework, we achieve equivalent performance as the baseline models, while reducing inference time compute by over two-fold. We validate our approach on standard image and video datasets - ImageNet-21K, Kinetics400, and Something-Something-v2. We further highlight MoNE’s adaptability by showcasing its ability to maintain strong performance across different inference-time compute budgets on videos, using only a single trained model.

These aspirations are both numerous and varied, motivated by issues that pertain to privacy, copyright, safety, and more. For example, unlearning is often invoked as a solution for removing the effects of targeted information from a generative-AI model’s parameters, e.g., a particular individual’s personal data or in-copyright expression of Spiderman that was included in the model’s training data. Unlearning is also proposed as a way to prevent a model from generating targeted types of information in its outputs, e.g., generations that closely resemble a particular individual’s data or reflect the concept of “Spiderman.” Both of these goals—the targeted removal of information from a model and the targeted suppression of information from a model’s outputs—present various technical and substantive challenges. We provide a framework for thinking rigorously about these challenges, which enables us to be clear about why unlearning is not a general-purpose solution for circumscribing generative-AI model behavior in service of broader positive impact. We aim for conceptual clarity and to encourage more thoughtful communication among machine learning (ML), law, and policy experts who seek to develop and apply technical methods for compliance with policy objectives.

Both fields generally use representations as a means to understand or improve a system's computations. In this work, however, we explore surprising dissociations between representation and computation that may pose challenges for such efforts. We create datasets in which we attempt to match the computational role that different features play, while manipulating other properties of the features or the data. We train various deep learning architectures to compute these multiple abstract features about their inputs. We find that their learned feature representations are systematically biased towards representing some features more strongly than others, depending upon extraneous properties such as feature complexity, the order in which features are learned, and the distribution of features over the inputs. For example, features that are simpler to compute or learned first tend to be represented more strongly and densely than features that are more complex or learned later, even if all features are learned equally well. We also explore how these biases are affected by architectures, optimizers, and training regimes (e.g., in transformers, features decoded earlier in the output sequence also tend to be represented more strongly). Our results help to characterize the inductive biases of gradient-based representation learning. We then illustrate the downstream effects of these biases on various commonly-used methods for analyzing or intervening on representations. These results highlight a key challenge for interpretability—or for comparing the representations of models and brains—disentangling extraneous biases from the computationally important aspects of a system's internal representations.

We study this underspecification problem in the context of text-to-image generation, and propose a probabilistic framework that can be used to construct customized T2I agents, which have the capability of interacting with the user by expressing uncertainty about their intent, seeking clarification, and iteratively aligning with the desired image that the user would like to see. We present blue prints for agents constructed under this framework, showcasing the dynamic user interactions it enables and the explainability of its state of mind. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the interface of our agent compared with traditional dialogue systems through a series of user studies. Empirically, we propose an evaluation pipeline to verify the performance of our proposed agent and user satisfaction conducted with human study.

When prompted, large language models (LLMs) can provide natural language explanations or reasoning traces that sound plausible and receive high ratings from human annotators. However, it is unclear to what extent these explanations are truly capturing the factors responsible for the model's predictions: the most ``human-like'' explanation may be different from the one that is most faithful to the model's true decision making process. In this work, we introduce the correlational counterfactual test (CCT), a faithfulness metric based on counterfactual input edits that takes into account not just the binary label change, but the total shift in the model's predicted label distribution. We evaluate the faithfulness of free-text explanations generated by few-shot-prompted LLMs from the Llama-2 family on three NLP tasks. We find that these explanations are indeed more likely to mention factors when they are impactful to the model's prediction, with the degree of association increasing with model size but varying significantly by task.

It comes with strong theoretical guarantees on the search effort required before finding a solution. It also comes with its own loss function (aka objective function) so that a parameterized policy can be learnt to minimize the search effort. Previously (NeurIPS 2018, AAAI 2021) we have used neural networks to learn the policy, with good results, but NNs make it hard to derive convergence guarantees. In this work we devise an alternative parameterized model, based on recent tools from the online compression literature, to ensure that the resulting search effort loss function remains convex, while making the model capable enough to tackle challenging search problems. Convexity has several important properties, and it particular it allows us to prove regret guarantees: given a stream of solution trajectories, the policy quickly converges to the optimum policy in the parameter space. The new model is able to combine predictions of both general and specific models, and, somewhat like NNs, can be overparameterized without losing generalization capabilities. We tackle 4 classic search application domains: Sokoban (boxoban), The Witness, 24-puzzle, and Rubik's cube. All these domains are combinatorial and almost no instance can be solved with random walks. Most known machine learning algorithms fail on at least one of these domains. We show that our new model combined with LTS matches and sometimes surpasses previous published results that use a neural network instead, and learn a low search-effort (i.e., fast) search policy to solve new instances of a test set.

Published 26 November 2024    View publication                   Share                                                  Copy link                   ×                          Abstract We evaluate the ability of today's LLMs to perform latent multi-hop reasoning on factual knowledge, or the latent composability of the models to internally recall and compose the facts separately learned during training, by assessing the model completions on multi-hop queries like ""In the year Scarlett Johansson was born, the Summer Olympics were hosted in the country of"". However, it may be challenging to accurately measure the latent reasoning ability without careful data construction and evaluation. For example, models may have developed shortcuts by numerous encounters of the head entity ""Scarlett Johansson"" and the answer entity ""United States"" in the same training sequences or merely guesses the answer based on frequency-based prior without going through a multi-hop reasoning process. To take this account, we propose desiderata about the dataset and evaluation for shortcut-free evaluation of latent multi-hop reasoning ability, and construct an evaluation dataset named SOCRATES (ShOrtCut-fRee lATent rEaSoning) to measure latent composability as rigorously as possible without access to the actual pretraining data. To be specific, we select the relation compositions and facts which would minimize the chance of models exploiting shortcuts and exclude the test queries where none of the combinations of the aliases of the head and answer entity have never appeared together in the any document of multiple different pretraining corpora, and even Google Search for some cases, of which the importance is shown through comparison with the misleading results obtained from a shortcut-prone version of the data. The experimental results with the shortcut-free dataset reveal that even today's best models lack generalization in latent compositionality; the ability differs dramatically according to the type of the bridge entity. Latent composability of the best models is only about 5% for the test queries where the bridge entity is a year, but the number is above 80% when the bridge entity is a country. Latent composability tends to increase roughly linearly with respect to the number of known single-hop facts, and tends to be higher for larger models, but the rate of increment and the gain from model scale also significantly differs according to the type of the bridge entity. Comparisons with Chain-of-Thought composability highlight a significant gap between latent and explicit reasoning. By performing initial investigations and drawing connections to related works, we suggest several unlikely and plausible hypotheses on the factors that may determine latent compositionality. In sum, our work provides the resource, insights, and potential future directions for precise evaluation, understanding, and improvement of latent reasoning of LLMs. Authors Sohee Yang, Nora Kassner, Elena Gribovskaya, Sebastian Riedel, Mor Geva Venue arXiv     Footer links    Follow us                                              About         About Google DeepMind   Responsibility & Safety   Research   Technologies   Blog   Careers        Learn more         Gemini   Veo   Imagen   SynthID                           Sign up for updates on our latest innovations                        Email address           Please enter a valid email (e.g., ""name@example.com"")     I accept Google's Terms and Conditions and acknowledge that my information will be used in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.

Our approach employs two stages: (1) a matching stage, which independently locates a suitable candidate point match for the query point on every other frame, and (2) a refinement stage, which updates both the trajectory and query features based on local correlations. The resulting model surpasses all baseline methods by a significant margin on the TAP-Vid benchmark, as demonstrated by an approximate 20% absolute average Jaccard (AJ) improvement on DAVIS. Our model facilitates fast inference on long and high-resolution video sequences. On a modern GPU, our implementation has the capacity to track points faster than real-time, and can be flexibly extended to higher-resolution videos. Given the high-quality trajectories extracted from a large dataset, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept diffusion model which generates trajectories from static images, enabling plausible animations.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) rise in popularity, it is necessary to assess their capability in this domain. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework, grounded in science communication principles, to analyze LLM responses on climate change topics. This framework emphasizes both the presentational and epistemological adequacy of answers, offering a fine-grained analysis of LLM response systems. Spanning 8 dimensions, our framework discerns up to 30 distinct issues in model outputs. The task is an excellent real-world example for a growing number of problems where LLM abilities can exceed those of humans. To address these challenges, we provide a practical protocol for scalable oversight using AI assistance, and rely on raters with relevant educational background. We evaluate several recent LLMs and conduct a thorough analysis of the results. Our comprehensive analysis sheds light on the potential and limitations of LLMs in the realm of climate communication.

Building upon this premise, this paper critically examines the role and efficacy of self-correction within LLMs, shedding light on its true potential and limitations. Central to our investigation is the notion of intrinsic self-correction, whereby an LLM attempts to correct its initial responses based solely on its inherent capabilities, without any external feedback. Contrary to popular belief, our research indicates that LLMs might find this task challenging, especially in the context of reasoning, and at times, their performance might even degrade post self-correction. Given our findings, we encourage the community to approach this concept with both prudence and critical consideration.

We argue that the predominant approach of fixing the hash function for the lifetime of the hash table is suboptimal and propose adapting it to the current set of keys. In the prevailing view, good hash functions spread the keys ``randomly'' and are fast to evaluate. General-purpose ones (e.g. Murmur) are designed to do both while remaining agnostic to the distribution of the keys, which limits their bucketing ability and wastes computation. When these shortcomings are recognised, the user of the hash table may specify a hash function more tailored to the expected key distribution, but doing so almost always introduces an unbounded risk in case their assumptions do not bear out in practice. At the other, fully key-aware end of the spectrum, Perfect Hashing algorithms can discover hash functions to bucket a given set of keys optimally, but they are costly to run and require the keys to be known and fixed ahead of time. Our main conceptual contribution is that adapting the hash table's hash function to the keys online is necessary for the best performance as adaptivity allows for better bucketing of keys and faster hash functions. We instantiate the idea of online adaptation with minimal overhead and no change to the hash table API. The experiments show that the adaptive approach marries the common-case performance of weak hash functions with the robustness of general-purpose ones.

Despite their success, MoEs suffer from a number of issues: training instability, token dropping, inability to scale the number of experts, or ineffective finetuning. In this work, we propose Soft MoE, a fully-differentiable sparse Transformer that addresses these challenges, while maintaining the benefits of MoEs. Soft MoE performs an implicit soft assignment by passing different weighted combinations of all input tokens to each expert. As in other MoEs, experts in Soft MoE only process a subset of the (combined) tokens, enabling larger model capacity (and performance) at lower inference cost. In the context of visual recognition, Soft MoE greatly outperforms dense Transformers (ViTs) and popular MoEs (Tokens Choice and Experts Choice). Furthermore, Soft MoE scales well: Soft MoE Huge/14 with 128 experts in 16 MoE layers has over $40\times$ more parameters than ViT Huge/14, with only 2% increased inference time, and substantially better quality.

We also adapt the proofs to AlphaGo's MCTS and its descendants (e.g., AlphaZero, Leela Zero) to also show $\exp_2(\exp_2(D - O(\log D)))$ regret.

Often, task success is defined based on the relationship between two objects - for instance, hanging a mug on a rack.  In such cases, the solution should be equivariant to the initial position of the objects as well as the agent, and invariant to the pose of the camera. This poses a challenge for learning systems which attempt to solve this task by learning directly from high-dimensional demonstrations: the agent must learn to be both equivariant as well as precise, which can be challenging without any inductive biases about the problem. In this work, we propose a method for precise relative pose prediction which is provably SE(3)-equivariant, can be learned from only a few demonstrations, and can generalize across variations in a class of objects. We accomplish this by factoring the problem into learning an SE(3) invariant task-specific representation of the scene and then interpreting this representation with novel geometric reasoning layers which are provably SE(3) equivariant. We demonstrate that our method can yield substantially more precise predictions in simulated placement tasks than previous methods trained with the same amount of data, and can accurately represent relative placement relationships data collected from real-world demonstrations.

This analysis is key to DP-SGD's success in machine learning, but, is not readily applicable to the newer state-of-the-art algorithms. This is because these algorithms, known as DP-FTRL, use the matrix mechanism to add correlated noise instead of independent noise as in DP-SGD. In this paper, we propose ""MMCC"", the first algorithm to analyze privacy amplification via sampling for any generic matrix mechanism. MMCC is nearly tight in that it approaches a lower bound as ϵ→0. To analyze correlated outputs in MMCC, we prove that they can be analyzed as if they were independent, by conditioning them on prior outputs. Our ""conditional composition theorem"" has broad utility: we use it to show that the noise added to binary-tree-DP-FTRL can asymptotically match the noise added to DP-SGD with amplification. Our amplification algorithm also has practical empirical utility: we show it leads to significant improvement in the privacy-utility trade-offs for DP-FTRL algorithms on standard benchmarks.

Key challenges in OCL include automatic adaptation to the specific non-stationary structure of the data and maintaining appropriate predictive uncertainty. To address these challenges we introduce a probabilistic Bayesian online learning approach that utilizes a (possibly pretrained) neural representation and a state space model over the linear predictor weights. Non-stationarity in the linear predictor weights is modelled using a “parameter drift” transition density, parametrized by a coefficient that quantifies forgetting. Inference in the model is implemented with efficient Kalman filter recursions which track the posterior distribution over the linear weights, while online SGD updates over the transition dynamics coefficient allow for adaptation to the non-stationarity observed in the data. While the framework is developed assuming a linear Gaussian model, we extend it to deal with classification problems and for fine-tuning the deep learning representation. In a set of experiments in multi-class classification using data sets such as CIFAR-100 and CLOC we demonstrate the model’s predictive ability and its flexibility in capturing non-stationarity.

In this paper, we work towards capturing both the 3D structure as well as the dynamics of real-world scenes from monocular real-world videos. Our model, the Dynamic Scene Transformer (DyST), builds upon recent work in neural scene representation and learns a latent decomposition into scene content as well as per-view scene dynamics and camera pose. This separation is achieved through a special co-training scheme on monocular videos and our new synthetic dataset DySO. DyST learns tangible latent representations for dynamic scenes that enable view generation with separate control over the camera and the content of the scene.

Their utility is assumed to be in identifying training examples ""responsible"" for a prediction so that, for example, correcting a prediction is possible by intervening on those examples (removing or editing them) and retraining the model. However, recent empirical studies have shown that the existing methods of estimating IF predict the leave-one-out-and-retrain effect poorly. In order to understand the mismatch between the theoretical promise and the practical results, we analyse five assumptions made by IF methods which are problematic for modern-scale deep neural networks and which concern convexity, numeric stability, training trajectory and parameter divergence. This allows us to clarify what can be expected theoretically from IF. We show that while most assumptions can be addressed successfully, the parameter divergence poses a clear limitation on the predictive power of IF: influence fades over training time even with deterministic training. We illustrate this theoretical result with BERT and ResNet models. Another conclusion from the theoretical analysis is that IF are still useful for model debugging and correcting even though some of the assumptions made in prior work do not hold: using natural language processing and computer vision tasks, we verify that mis-predictions can be successfully corrected by taking only a few fine-tuning steps on influential examples.

Feature visualizations attempt to answer this important question by visualizing highly activating patterns through optimization. Today, visualization methods form the foundation of our knowledge about the internal workings of neural networks, as a type of mechanistic interpretability. Here we ask: How reliable are feature visualizations? We start our investigation by developing network circuits that trick feature visualizations into showing arbitrary patterns that are completely disconnected from normal network behavior on natural input. We then provide evidence for a similar phenomenon occurring in standard, unmanipulated networks: feature visualizations are processed very differently from standard input, casting doubt on their ability to “explain” how neural networks process natural images. We underpin this empirical finding by theory proving that the set of functions that can be reliably understood by feature visualization is extremely small and does not include black-box neural networks.

Current methods to quantify them are either heuristic or computationally demanding. We introduce BayesRays, a post-hoc framework to evaluate uncertainty in any pre-trained NeRF without modifying the training process. Our method establishes a volumetric uncertainty field using spatial perturbations and a Bayesian Laplace approximation. We derive our algorithm statistically and show its superior performance in key metrics and applications.

Our method combines the strengths of foundation models that serve as generic and powerful state representations and successor features that can model the future occurrence of the states for a policy. π2vec represents the behavior of policies by capturing the statistics of the features from a pretrained model with the help of successor feature framework. We focus on the offline setting where policies and their representations are trained on a fixed dataset of trajectories. Finally, we employ linear regression on π2vec vector representations to predict the performance of held out policies. The synergy of these techniques results in a method for efficient policy evaluation in resource constrained environments.

Large language models (LMs) achieve above-chance performance on abstract reasoning tasks but exhibit many imperfections. However, human abstract reasoning is also imperfect. Human reasoning is affected by our real-world knowledge and beliefs, and shows notable “content effects”; humans reason more reliably when the semantic content of a problem supports the correct logical inferences. These content-entangled reasoning patterns are central to debates about the fundamental nature of human intelligence. Here, we investigate whether language models—whose prior expectations capture some aspects of human knowledge—similarly mix content into their answers to logic problems. We explored this question across three logical reasoning tasks: natural language inference, judging the logical validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. We evaluate state of the art LMs, as well as humans, and find that the LMs reflect many of the same qualitative human patterns on these tasks—like humans, models answer more accurately when the semantic content of a task supports the logical inferences. These parallels are reflected in accuracy patterns, and in some lower-level features like the relationship between LM confidence over possible answers and human response times. However, in some cases the humans and models behave differently—particularly on the Wason task, where humans perform much worse than large models, and exhibit a distinct error pattern. Our findings have implications for understanding possible contributors to these human cognitive effects, as well as the factors that influence language model performance.

We present AlphaMissense, an adaptation of AlphaFold fine-tuned on human and primate variant population frequency databases to predict missense variant pathogenicity. By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data. The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect. As a resource to the community, we provide a database of predictions for all possible human single amino acid substitutions and classify 89% of missense variants as either likely benign or likely pathogenic.

In this work, we propose a new practical data extraction attack that we call ``neural phishing''. This attack enables an adversary to target and extract sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII), e.g., credit card numbers, from a model trained on user data with upwards of 10% attack success rates, at times, as high as 50%. Our attack assumes only that an adversary can insert as few as 10s of benign-appearing sentences into the training dataset using only vague priors on the structure of the user data.

Although past work created increasingly general solutions for the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) formulation, these have not been successfully scaled to world-sized MDPs (200M states), large datasets (110M samples), and nearly foundation-sized models (360M parameters). In this work, we surpass this scale through a series of advancements focused on graph compression, parallelization, and problem initialization based on dominant eigenvectors. We introduce Receding Horizon Inverse Planning (RHIP), an approximated IRL algorithm which generalizes existing work and enables control of key performance trade-offs via a planning horizon parameter. Our policy achieves an 18% improvement in global route quality, and, to our knowledge, is the largest instance of IRL in a real-world setting to date. We include insightful negative results on state-of-the-art eigenvalue solvers, and identify future opportunities to further improve performance via IRL-specific batching strategies. Our results show critical benefits to more sustainable modes of transportation (e.g. two-wheelers), where factors beyond journey time (e.g. route safety) play an outsized role.

This includes many of the most popular examples of kernels defined on the nodes of a graph. Our algorithm enjoys subquadratic time complexity with respect to the number of nodes, overcoming the notoriously prohibitive cubic scaling of exact graph kernel evaluation. It can also be trivially distributed across machines, permitting learning on much larger networks. At the heart of the algorithm is a modulation function which upweights or downweights the contribution from different random walks depending on their lengths. We show that by parameterising it with a neural network we can obtain u-GRFs that give higher-quality kernel estimates or perform efficient, scalable kernel learning. We provide robust theoretical analysis and support our findings with experiments including pointwise estimation of fixed graph kernels, solving non-homogeneous graph ordinary differential equations, node clustering and kernel regression on triangular meshes.

Using the concepts and principles to guide the reasoning steps, LLMs significantly improve their abilities in following a correct reasoning path towards the solution. We conduct experiments of STEP-BACK PROMPTING with PaLM-2 models and observe substantial performance gains on a wide range of challenging reasoning-intensive tasks including STEM, Knowledge QA, and Multi-Hop Reasoning. For instance, STEP-BACK PROMPTING improves PaLM-2L performance on MMLU Physics and Chemistry by 7% and 11%, TimeQA by 34%, and MuSiQue by 7%.

Using the concepts and principles to guide the reasoning steps, LLMs significantly improve their abilities in following a correct reasoning path towards the solution. We conduct experiments of STEP-BACK PROMPTING with PaLM-2 models and observe substantial performance gains on a wide range of challenging reasoning-intensive tasks including STEM, Knowledge QA, and Multi-Hop Reasoning. For instance, STEP-BACK PROMPTING improves PaLM-2L performance on MMLU Physics and Chemistry by 7% and 11%, TimeQA by 34%, and MuSiQue by 7%.",9 October 2023,"Steven Zheng, Swaroop Mishra, Xinyun Chen, Heng-Tze Cheng, Ed Chi, Quoc Le, Denny Zhou","['ai', 'agi', 'levels', 'breakthroughs', 'systems']"

The method requires no explicit orthogonalization of the different states, instead transforming the problem of finding excited states of a given system into that of finding the ground state of an expanded system. Expected values of arbitrary observables can be calculated, including mixed expectations between different states such as the transition dipole moment. Although the method is entirely general, it works particularly well in conjunction with recent work on using neural networks as variational Ansätze for many-electron systems, and we show that by combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer Ansätze we can accurately recover vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths on molecules as large as benzene. Beyond the examples on molecules presented here, we expect this technique will be of great interest for applications of variational quantum Monte Carlo to atomic, nuclear and condensed matter physics.

In our approach, we approximate the joint distribution of a fully-flexible triclinic simulation box and particle coordinates to achieve a desired internal pressure. This novel extension of flow-based sampling to the isobaric-isothermal ensemble yields direct estimates of Gibbs free energies. We test our NPT-flow on monatomic water in the cubic and hexagonal ice phases and find excellent agreement of Gibbs free energies and other observables compared with established baselines.

Many stakeholders -- such as researchers, policy makers, and insurers -- use this data to better understand the earth system and guide policy decisions. Atmospheric states have also received increased interest as machine learning approaches to weather prediction have shown promising results. A key issue for all audiences is that dense time series of these high-dimensional states comprise an enormous amount of data, precluding all but the most well resourced groups from accessing and using historical data and future projections. To address this problem, we propose a method for compressing atmospheric states using methods from the neural network literature, adapting spherical data to processing by conventional neural architectures through the use of the area-preserving HEALPix projection. We investigate two model classes for building neural compressors: the hyperprior model from the neural image compression literature and recent vector-quantised models. We show that both families of models satisfy the desiderata of small average error, a small number of high-error reconstructed pixels, faithful reproduction of extreme events such as hurricanes and heatwaves, preservation of the spectral power distribution across spatial scales. We demonstrate compression ratios in excess of 1000x, with compression and decompression at a rate of approximately one second per global atmospheric state.

Current approaches lack either the generality to onboard new tasks without task-specific engineering, or else lack the data-efficiency to do so in an amount of time that enables practical use. In this work we explore dense tracking as a representational bottleneck to allow fast and general-purpose learning from demonstration. Our approach utilizes Track-Any-Point (TAP) models to isolate the relevant motion in a demonstration, and parameterize a low-level controller to reproduce this motion across changes in the scene. We show that this results in robust robot policies that can solve complex object-arrangement tasks such as kitting, stacking up to four objects, and even full path-following tasks such as applying glue and sticking objects together, all from demonstrations that can be collected in minutes.

While the most common private learning algorithm, DP-SGD, adds independent Gaussian noise in each iteration, recent work on matrix factorization mechanisms has shown empirically that introducing correlations in the noise can greatly improve their utility. We characterize the asymptotic learning utility for any choice of the correlation function, giving precise analytical bounds for linear regression and as the solution to a convex program for general convex functions. We show, using these bounds, how correlated noise provably improves upon vanilla DP-SGD as a function of problem parameters such as the effective dimension and condition number. Moreover, our analytical expression for the near-optimal correlation function circumvents the cubic complexity of the semi-definite program used to optimize the noise correlation matrix in previous work. We validate our theory with experiments on private deep learning. Our work matches or outperforms prior work while being efficient both in terms of compute and memory. Authors Christopher A.

The integration of both approaches has proven to be highly successful in addressing complex sequential decision-making challenges, as evidenced by algorithms such as AlphaZero and MuZero, which consolidate the planning process into a parametric search-policy. AIXI, the most potent theoretical universal agent, leverages planning through comprehensive search as its primary means to find an optimal policy. Here we define an alternative universal agent, which we call Self-AIXI, that on the contrary to AIXI, maximally exploits learning to obtain good policies. It does so by self-predicting its own stream of action data, which is generated, similarly to other TD(0) agents, by taking an action maximization step over the current on-policy (universal mixture-policy) Q-value estimates. We prove that Self-AIXI converges to AIXI, and inherits a series of properties like maximal Legg-Hutter intelligence and the self-optimizing property.

Perhaps the next milestone for generative models is to simulate the real world in response to actions carried out by humans, robots, and other types of interactive agents. Applications of a real-world simulator range from controllable content creation in games and movies to training embodied agents purely in simulation that can be directly deployed in the real world. In this paper, we explore these possibilities around learning a universal simulator (UniSim) of real-world interactions through generative modeling. We first make the important observation that natural datasets available for learning a real-world simulator are often rich in different axes (e.g., rich labeled objects in image data, rich actions in robotics data, and rich movements in navigation data). With careful orchestration of diverse datasets each serving a different piece of the puzzle, UniSim can emulate how humans and agents interact with the world by simulating the visual outcome of both high-level instructions such as “open the drawer” and low-level controls such as “move to x, y location” from otherwise static scenes and objects. The usage of a real-world simulator is vast. As an example, we use UniSim to simulate interactive experiences to train high-level vision-language planners and low-level reinforcement learning policies, both of which exhibit significant real-world transfer from purely training in a real-world like simulator. Lastly, we show that other types of intelligence such as video captioning and detection models can also benefit from simulated experiences of UniSim, opening up even wider applications of a real-world simulator.

By inducing correlations between the trajectories of an interacting ensemble such that their marginal transition probabilities are unmodified, we are able to explore the graph more efficiently, improving the concentration of statistical estimators whilst leaving them unbiased. The mechanism has a trivial drop-in implementation. We showcase the effectiveness of repelling random walks in a range of settings including estimation of graph kernels, the PageRank vector and graphlet concentrations. We provide detailed experimental evaluation and robust theoretical guarantees. To our knowledge, repelling random walks constitute the first rigorously studied quasi-Monte Carlo scheme correlating the directions of walkers on a graph, inviting new research in this exciting nascent domain.

First presented in Universal Algorithmic Intelligence (Hutter, 2000), UAI offers a framework in which virtually all AI problems can be formulated, and a theory of how to solve them. UAI unifies ideas from sequential decision theory, Bayesian inference, and algorithmic information theory to construct AIXI, an optimal reinforcement learning agent that learns to act optimally in unknown environments. AIXI is the theoretical gold standard for intelligent behavior. The book covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of UAI. Bayesian updating can be done efficiently with context tree weighting, and planning can be approximated by sampling with Monte Carlo tree search. It provides algorithms for the reader to implement, and experimental results to compare against. These algorithms are used to approximate AIXI. The book ends with a philosophical discussion of Artificial General Intelligence: Can super-intelligent agents even be constructed? Is it inevitable that they will be constructed, and what are the potential consequences? This text is suitable for late undergraduate students. It provides an extensive chapter to fill in the required mathematics, probability, information, and computability theory background.

Traditional analytic simulators sometimes struggle to capture sufficiently realistic simulation which can lead to problems including the well known ""sim-to-real"" gap. Learned simulators have emerged as an alternative for better capturing real-world physical dynamics, but require access to privileged ground truth physics information such as precise object geometry or particle tracks. Here we propose a method for learning simulators directly from observations.  Visual Particle Dynamics (VPD) jointly learns a latent particle-based representation of 3D scenes, a neural simulator of the dynamics of that representation, and a renderer that can produce images of the scene from arbitrary views. VPD learns end to end from posed videos and does not require access to privileged information. Unlike existing 2D video prediction models, we show that 3D inductive biases enable VPD to compositionally generalize and make long-term predictions. These results pave the way for downstream applications ranging from video editing to robotic planning.

In this work, we introduce a new prompting approach, analogical reasoning, designed to automatically guide the reasoning process of large language models. Drawing inspiration from how humans recall relevant past experiences when addressing new challenges, our approach makes language models self-generate relevant exemplars or lessons in the context, before proceeding to solve the given problem. This method presents several advantages: it obviates the need for manual annotation or external data retrieval, offering generality and convenience, while also tailoring generated exemplars to each unique problem, offering adaptability. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms 0-shot CoT and few-shot CoT in a variety of reasoning tasks, including math problem solving in GSM8K and MATH, code generation in Codeforces, and other reasoning tasks in BIG-Bench, with an average accuracy gain of +5%.

While there has been much work on applying these representations to various types of signals, the portfolio of signal processing tools that has been built up around discrete signal representations has seen only limited application to the world of neural fields. In this paper, we address this problem by showing how a probabilistic re-interpretation of neural fields can enable their training and inference processes to become filter aware. The formulation we propose not only merges training and filtering in an efficient way, but also generalizes beyond the familiar Euclidean coordinate spaces to the more general set of smooth manifolds and convolutions induced by the actions of Lie groups. We demonstrate how this framework can enable novel filtering applications for neural fields on both Euclidean domains, such as images and audio, as well as non-Euclidean domains, such as rotations and rays. This is achieved with minimal modification to network architecture and training pipelines, and without an increase in computational complexity.

Inverse graphics is an appealing approach to 3D scene understanding that aims to infer the 3D scene structure from 2D images. In this paper, we introduce probabilistic modeling to the inverse graphics framework to quantify uncertainty and achieve robustness in 6D pose estimation tasks. Specifically, we propose 3D Neural Embedding Likelihood (3DNEL) as a unified probabilistic model over RGB-D images, and develop efficient inference procedures on 3D scene descriptions. 3DNEL effectively combines learned neural embeddings from RGB with depth information to improve robustness in sim-to-real 6D object pose estimation from RGB-D images. Performance on the YCB-Video dataset is on par with state-of-the-art yet is much more robust in challenging regimes. In contrast to discriminative approaches, 3DNEL's probabilistic generative formulation jointly models multiple objects in a scene, quantifies uncertainty in a principled way, and handles object pose tracking under heavy occlusion. Finally, 3DNEL provides a principled framework for incorporating prior knowledge about the scene and objects, which allows natural extension to additional tasks like camera pose tracking from video.

Owing to the inherent multi-modal nature of many robotic tasks, combined with the recent successes in generative modeling, researchers have turned to state-of-the-art probabilistic models such as diffusion models for policy representation. In this work, we revisit the choice of energy-based models (EBM) as a policy class. We show that the prevailing folklore---that energy models in high dimensional continuous spaces are notoriously difficult to train and hence impractical---is false. We develop a practical training objective and algorithm for energy models which combines several key ingredients: (i) ranking noise contrastive estimation (R-NCE), (ii) learnable negative samplers, and (iii) non-adversarial joint training. We prove that our proposed objective function is asymptotically consistent and quantify its limiting variance. On the other hand, we show that the Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC) objective is actually biased even at the population level, providing a mathematical explanation for the poor performance of IBC trained energy policies in several independent follow-up works. We further extend our algorithm to learn a continuous stochastic process that bridges noise and data, modeling this process with a family of EBMs indexed by scale variable. In doing so, we demonstrate that the core idea behind recent progress in generative modeling is actually compatible with EBMs. Altogether, our proposed training algorithms enable us to train energy based models as policies which compete with---and even outperform---diffusion models and other state-of-the-art approaches in several challenging multi-modal benchmarks: obstacle avoidance path planning and contact-rich block pushing.

Even though every game has a Nash equilibrium, it is not known whether there are deterministic behaviors of the players who play a game repeatedly that are guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium of the game from all starting points. If one assumes that the players’ behavior is a discrete-time or continuous-time rule whereby the current mixed strategy profile is mapped to the next, this question becomes a problem in the theory of dynamical systems. We apply this theory, and in particular Conley index theory, to prove a general impossibility result: There exist games, for which all game dynamics fail to converge to Nash equilibria from all starting points. The games which help prove this impossibility result are degenerate, but we conjecture that the same result holds, under computational complexity assumptions, for nondegenerate games. We also prove a stronger impossibility result for the solution concept of approximate Nash equilibria: For a set of games of positive measure, no game dynamics can converge to the set of approximate Nash equilibria for a sufficiently small yet substantial approximation bound. Our results establish that, although the notions of Nash equilibrium and its computation-inspired approximations are universally applicable in all games, they are fundamentally incomplete as predictors of long-term player behavior.

For example, video and audio are obtained at much higher rates than text and are roughly aligned in time. They are not necessarily synchronized with text which is often present as a global context, e.g. a title or description. Furthermore, video and audio inputs are of much larger volumes, and can grow with the increase of the video lengths, which naturally requires more compute dedicated to these modalities and makes modeling of long-range dependencies harder. We here decouple the multimodal modeling, dividing it into separate, focused autoregressive models, processing the inputs according to the characteristics of the modalities and their sampling rates. More specifically, we propose a multimodal model, consisting of an autoregressive component for the time-synchronized modalities (audio and video), and an autoregressive component for modalities which are not necessarily aligned in time but are still sequential. To address the long-sequences of the video-audio inputs, we propose to further partition the video and audio sequences and autoregressively process their compact learned representations. To that end, we propose a Combiner mechanism, which models the audio-video information within a video snippet. The Combiner first learns to extract audio and visual features from raw spatio-temporal signals, and then learns to fuse these features producing compact but expressive representations per snippet, which are added to the subsequent autoregressive modeling in time. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art on well established multimodal benchmarks, outperforming much larger models. It effectively addresses the high computational demand of media inputs by both learning compact representations, controlling the sequence length of the audio-video feature representations, and producing powerful visual and audio representations which allow for long-term dependencies and modeling of long-form video or video/audio inputs in time.

Our compiler, Tracr, generates models with known structure. This structure can be used to design experiments. For example, we use it to study ""superposition"" in transformers that execute multi-step algorithms. Additionally, the known structure of Tracr-compiled models can serve as ground-truth for evaluating interpretability methods. Commonly, because the ""programs"" learned by transformers are unknown it is unclear whether an interpretation succeeded. We demonstrate our approach by implementing and examining programs including computing token frequencies, sorting, and parenthesis checking. We provide an open-source implementation of Tracr at https://github.com/google-deepmind/tracr.

This framework introduces levels of AGI performance, generality, and autonomy, providing a common language to compare models, assess risks, and measure progress along the path to AGI. To develop our framework, we analyze existing definitions of AGI, and distill six principles that a useful ontology for AGI should satisfy. With these principles in mind, we propose ""Levels of AGI"" based on depth (performance) and breadth (generality) of capabilities, and reflect on how current systems fit into this ontology. We discuss the challenging requirements for future benchmarks that quantify the behavior and capabilities of AGI models against these levels. Finally, we discuss how these levels of AGI interact with deployment considerations such as autonomy and risk, and emphasize the importance of carefully selecting Human-AI Interaction paradigms for responsible and safe deployment of highly capable AI systems.

An Evaluation of LLMs' Humour Alignment with Comedians  Published 5 June 2024    View publication      Download                   Share                                                  Copy link                   ×                          Abstract We interviewed professional comedians who perform live shows in front of audiences and who use artificial intelligence in their artistic process. To that end, we recruited ten participants at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2023 and ten more participants online for 3-hour workshops on ""AI x Comedy"", aiming to ensure linguistic, cultural, gender, sexual, national and racial diversity among participants. The workshop consisted of a comedy writing session with large language models (LLMs), a human-computer interaction questionnaire to assess the Creativity Support Index of the AI writing tool, and a focus group. Guided discussions in the focus group touched about the comedians' motivations and artistic processes, the biases and potentials of the LLM tools and their limitations as a Creativity Support Tool, as well as the comedians' ethical concerns about bias, censorship and copyright. Participants noted that the moderation strategies used during instruction-tuning of the LLMs reinforced hegemonic viewpoints by erasing minority groups, and qualified this as a form of censorship. At the same time, the LLMs did not succeed as a good creativity support tool, by producing stereotypical and biased comedy tropes, akin to ""cruise ship comedy material from the 1950ies, but a bit less racist"". Our work extends scholarship about the subtle difference between ""offensive"" language as a practice of resistance---and, equivalently, in comedy, of ""punching up"" and satire---and harmful speech. We also interrogate the global value alignment behind such language models and discuss community-based value alignment and data ownership to build AI tools that better suit the artists' needs.
